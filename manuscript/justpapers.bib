@article{Felsenstein1985Confidence,
    abstract = {{The recently-developed statistical method known as the "bootstrap" can be used to place confidence intervals on phylogenies. It involves resampling points from one's own data, with replacement, to create a series of bootstrap samples of the same size as the original data. Each of these is analyzed, and the variation among the resulting estimates taken to indicate the size of the error involved in making estimates from the original data. In the case of phylogenies, it is argued that the proper method of resampling is to keep all of the original species while sampling characters with replacement, under the assumption that the characters have been independently drawn by the systematist and have evolved independently. Majority-rule consensus trees can be used to construct a phylogeny showing all of the inferred monophyletic groups that occurred in a majority of the bootstrap samples. If a group shows up 95\% of the time or more, the evidence for it is taken to be statistically significant. Existing computer programs can be used to analyze different bootstrap samples by using weights on the characters, the weight of a character being how many times it was drawn in bootstrap sampling. When all characters are perfectly compatible, as envisioned by Hennig, bootstrap sampling becomes unnecessary; the bootstrap method would show significant evidence for a group if it is defined by three or more characters.}},

@article{Nixon1999Parsimony,
    abstract = {{The Parsimony Ratchet1 is presented as a new method for analysis of large data sets. The method can be easily implemented with existing phylogenetic software by generating batch command files. Such an approach has been implemented in the programs DADA (Nixon, 1998) and Winclada (Nixon, 1999). The Parsimony Ratchet has also been implemented in the most recent versions of NONA (Goloboff, 1998). These implementations of the ratchet use the following steps: (1) Generate a starting tree (e.g., a  ” Wagner” tree followed by some level of branch swapping or not). (2) Randomly select a subset of characters, each of which is given additional weight (e.g., add 1 to the weight of each selected character). (3) Perform branch swapping (e.g.,  ” branch-breaking” or TBR) on the current tree using the reweighted matrix, keeping only one (or few) tree. (4) Set all weights for the characters to the  ” original” weights (typically, equal weights). (5) Perform branch swapping (e.g., branch-breaking or TBR) on the current tree (from step 3) holding one (or few) tree. (6) Return to step 2. Steps 2–6 are considered to be one iteration, and typically, 50–200 or more iterations are performed. The number of characters to be sampled for reweighting in step 2 is determined by the user; I have found that between 5 and 25\% of the characters provide good results in most cases. The performance of the ratchet for large data sets is outstanding, and the results of analyses of the 500 taxon seed plant rbcL data set (Chase et al., 1993) are presented here. A separate analysis of a three-gene data set for 567 taxa will be presented elsewhere (Soltis et al., in preparation) demonstrating the same extraordinary power. With the 500-taxon data set, shortest trees are typically found within 22 h (four runs of 200 iterations) on a 200-MHz Pentium Pro. These analyses indicate efficiency increases of 20×–80× over  ” traditional methods” such as varying taxon order randomly and holding few trees, followed by more complete analyses of the best trees found, and thousands of times faster than nonstrategic searches with PAUP. Because the ratchet samples many tree islands with fewer trees from each island, it provides much more accurate estimates of the  ” true” consensus than collecting many trees from few islands. With the ratchet, Goloboff's NONA, and existing computer hardware, data sets that were previously intractable or required months or years of analysis with PAUP* can now be adequately analyzed in a few hours or days.}},

Effective analysis of large data sets can be carried out in reasonable times, and a number of methods to help identifying wildcard taxa in the case of ambiguous data sets are implemented. A variety of methods for diagnosing trees and exploring character evolution is available in TNT, and publication-quality tree-diagrams can be saved as metafiles. Through the use of a number of native commands and a simple but powerful scripting language, TNT allows the user an enormous flexibility in phylogenetic analyses or simulations. {\copyright} The Willi Hennig Society 2008.}},

@article{Goloboff2003Improvements,
    abstract = {{Abstract Several aspects of current resampling methods to assess group support are reviewed. When the characters have different prior weights or some state transformation costs are different, the frequencies under either bootstrapping or jackknifing can be distorted, producing either under- or overestimations of the actual group support. This is avoided by symmetric resampling, where the probability p of increasing the weight of a character equals the probability of decreasing it. Problems with interpreting absolute group frequencies as a measure of the support are discussed; group support does not necessarily vary with the frequency itself, since in some cases groups with positive support may have much lower frequencies than groups with no support at all. Three possible solutions for this problem are suggested. The first is measuring the support as the difference in frequency between the group and its most frequent contradictory group. The second is calculating frequencies for values of p below the threshold under which the frequency ranks the groups in the right order of support (this threshold may vary from data set to data set). The third is estimating the support by using the slope of the frequency as a function of different (low) values of p; when p is low, groups with actual support have negative slopes (closer to 0 when the support is higher), and groups with no support have positive slopes (larger when evidence for and against the group is more abundant).}},

These tissues are commonly found as isolated elements in the fossil record and studied as three separate partitions: the dentition, the cranium, and the postcranium. The relative phylogenetic utility of characters from each partition is often called into question with respect to varying amounts of homoplasy. In this paper, the consistency index (CI) was used to measure levels of homoplasy in each data partition for a sample of fossil and living primates. Sources of bias in the collection and treatment of data and in the internal structure of the data set are addressed. These biases include number of taxa, number of characters, ordering of characters, amounts of polymorphically scored or missing data, and character-state distribution. The results of this study suggest that the levels of homoplasy are very similar, though the postcranial data may be slightly less homoplastic than either the dental or cranial data.}},

To examine the relative utility of behavior and morphology for estimating phylogeny, we compared levels of homoplasy for morphological and behavioral characters that have been used in systematic studies. In an analysis of 22 data sets that contained both morphological and behavioral characters we found no significant difference between mean consistency indices (CIs, which measure homoplasy) within data sets for the two types of characters. In a second analysis we compared overall CIs for 8 data sets comprised entirely of behavioral characters with overall CIs for 32 morphological data sets and found no significant difference between the two types of data sets. For both analyses, 95\% confidence limits on the difference between the two types of characters indicate that, even if given the benefit of the doubt, morphological characters could not have substantially higher mean CIs than behavioral characters. These results do not support the idea that behavioral characters are less useful than morphological characters for the estimation of phylogeny.}},

Tests show that HSR is not correlated with numbers of characters and taxa, and this quality makes the index particularly useful for comparing the levels of observed homoplasy among cladistic analyses based on data sets of different sizes.

@article{Brandley2009Homoplasy,
    abstract = {{10.1093/sysbio/syp019 Distinguishing phylogenetic signal from homoplasy (shared similarities among taxa that do not arise by common ancestry) is an implicit goal of any phylogenetic study. Large amounts of homoplasy can interfere with accurate tree inference, and it is expected that common measures of clade support, including bootstrap proportions and Bayesian posterior probabilities, should also be impacted to some degree by homoplasy. Through data simulation and analysis of 38 empirical data sets, we show that high amounts of homoplasy will affect all measures of clade support in a manner that is dependent on clade size. More specifically, the smallest taxon bipartitions in an unrooted tree topology will receive higher support relative to clades of intermediate sizes, even when all clades are supported by the same amount of data. We determine that the ultimate causes of this effect are the inclusion of random trees (due to homoplasy) during bootstrap resampling and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) topology searching and the higher relative proportion of small taxon bipartitions (i.e., 2 or 3 taxa) to larger sized bipartitions. However, the use of explicit model-based methods, especially Bayesian MCMC methods, effectively overcomes this clade size effect even when very small amounts of phylogenetic signal are present. We develop a post hoc statistic, the clade disparity index (CDI), to measure both the relative magnitude of the clade size effect and its statistical significance. In analyses of both simulated and empirical data, CDI values indicate that Bayesian MCMC analyses are substantially more likely to estimate clade support values that are uncorrelated with clade size than are maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood bootstrap analyses and thus less affected by homoplasy. These results may be especially relevant to \^{a}deep\^{a} phylogenetic problems, such as reconstructing the tree of life, as they represent the largest possible extremes of time and evolutionary rates, 2 factors that cause homoplasy.}},

    abstract = {{10.2307/2992286 Comparative systematic studies may use different sets of data or different sets of taxa to evaluate the quality of phylogenetic data and phylogenetic hypotheses based on levels of homoplasy as implied by the length of minimum length trees. For comparisons involving diverse arrays of characters and taxa, an appropriate index is required to permit comparisons. Examination of the number of steps per character (NSC) on minimum length trees for 28 data sets revealed a highly significant positive correlation between NSC and the number of taxa and, concomitantly, a highly significant negative correlation between the consistency index (CI) of Kluge and Farris (1969) and the number of taxa. Theoretical expectations from a study of the number of steps on random and minimum length trees (Archie and Felsenstein, 1989) agree with this finding. Computer simulations using randomly selected subsets of taxa and characters from the Drosophila data set of Throckmorton (1968) revealed a similar finding. The latter two studies also revealed a negative relationship between the CI and the number of characters in a study. These findings imply that the CI is not an appropriate index of homoplasy for comparative taxonomic studies. A new index, the homoplasy excess ratio (HER), is introduced that takes into account the expected increase in overall homoplasy levels with increasing numbers of taxa in systematic studies. The properties of HER are examined for the 28 data sets taken from the literature and, in conjunction with the simulations using the Drosophila data set, HER is shown to be more appropriate than CI in comparative taxonomic studies that wish to measure the average level of homoplasy in data sets involving different groups of taxa or different characters. Because HER is a computationally intensive statistic to calculate, two estimates are derived and examined. These estimates, the random expected homoplasy excess ratio (REHER) and the homoplasy excess ratio minimum (HERM), can be easily calculated from the formulas of Archie and Felsenstein (1989) and from intrinsic properties of the data matrix, respectively. HERM is shown to be a better estimator of HER and a linear regression equation is derived to estimate HER from HERM.}},

@article{Sanderson1989Patterns,
    abstract = {{Patterns of variation in levels of homoplasy were explored through statistical analyses of standardized consistency indexes. Data were obtained from 60 recent cladistic analyses of a wide variety of organisms based on several different kinds of characters. Consistency index is highly correlated with the number of taxa included in an analysis, with homoplasy increasing as the number of taxa increases. This observation is compatible with a simple model of character evolution in which 1) the probability of character-state change increases with the total number of branches in a tree and 2) the number of possible states of a character is limited. Consistency index does not show a significant relationship to the number of characters utilized in an analysis or to the taxonomic rank of the terminal taxa. When the relationship between consistency index and number of taxa is taken into account, there is no significant difference between plant and animal data sets in the amount of homoplasy. Likewise, the level of homoplasy in morphological and molecular data sets does not appear to differ significantly, although there are still too few molecular studies to be confident of this result. Future comparisons of consistency indexes, including studies along the lines established here, must take into account the influence of the number of taxa on homoplasy.}},

@article{Song2010Comparison,
    abstract = {Abstract It is generally accepted that male genitalia evolve more rapidly and divergently relative to non-genital traits due to sexual selection, but there is little quantitative comparison of the pattern of evolution between these character sets. Moreover, despite the fact that genitalia are still among the most widely used characters in insect systematics, there is an idea that the rate of evolution is too rapid for genital characters to be useful in forming clades. Based on standard measures of fit used in cladistic analyses, we compare levels of homoplasy and synapomorphy between genital and non-genital characters of published data sets and demonstrate that phylogenetic signal between these two character sets is statistically similar. This pattern is found consistently across different insect orders at different taxonomic hierarchical levels. We argue that the fact that male genitalia are under sexual selection and thus diverge rapidly does not necessarily equate with the lack of phylogenetic signal, because characters that evolve by descent with modification make appropriate characters for a phylogenetic analysis, regardless of the rate of evolution. We conclude that male genitalia are a composite character consisting of different components diverging separately, which make them ideal characters for phylogenetic analyses, providing information for resolving varying levels of hierarchy. {\\\\\\\\copyright} The Willi Hennig Society 2009.},

@article{Goloboff1991HOMOPLASY,
    abstract = {{Abstract Cladistic data are more decisive when the possible trees differ more in tree length. When all the possible dichotomous trees have the same length, no one tree is better supported than the others, and the data are completely undecisive. From a rule for recursively generating undecisive matrices for different numbers of taxa, formulas to calculate consistency, rescaled consistency and retention indices in undecisive matrices are derived. The least decisive matrices are not the matrices with the lowest possible consistency, rescaled consistency or retention indices (on the most parsimonious trees); those statistics do not directly vary with decisiveness. Decisiveness can be measured with a newly proposed statistic, DD=S̄−S)/(S̄−S) (where S= length of the most parsimonious cladogram, S̄= mean length of all the possible cladograms for the data set and M= observed variation). For any data set, S̄ can be calculated exactly with simple formulas; it depends on the types of characters present, and not on their congruence. Despite some recent assertions to the contrary, the consistency index is an appropriate measure of homoplasy (= deviation from hierarchy). The retention index seems more appropriate for comparing the fit of different trees for the same data set.}},

@article{SanchezVillagra1998Levels,
    abstract = {{It is commonly believed that there are differences in the evolutionary lability of the crania, dentition, and postcrania of mammals, the latter two being more prone to homoplasy because of strong selective pressures for feeding and locomotion, respectively. Further, because of the fragmentary nature of fossils, phylogenetic analyses of extinct taxa often must utilize characters based on only one of these systems. In this paper the levels of homoplasy (as measured by the consistency index; CI) were compared in characters based on these three anatomical systems in therian mammals. No statistically significant differences were found in the overall CIs of 41 data sets based on dental, cranial, or postcranial characters. Differences in homoplasy within data sets with two or three kinds of data were not statistically significant. These findings suggest that dental, cranial, and postcranial characters can be equally prone to homoplasy and none should be automatically dismissed, disregarded, or systematically weighted in phylogenetic analyses. The level of homoplasy in characters derived from a given region of the skeleton may differ depending on the taxonomic level of the taxa considered. Dental, cranial, and postcranial characters may not constitute ” natural” classes, yet examination of the phylogenetic signal of these subsets of data previous to a simultaneous analysis can shed light on significant aspects of the evolutionary process.}},
