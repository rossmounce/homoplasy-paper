  Abstract                 = {{A morphological study of the postcranial skeleton of Procolophon trigoniceps from the Lower Triassic of South Africa and Antarctica is undertaken. Procolophon shares a sister-group relationship with the procolophonid Tichvinskia from the Lower Triassic of Russia and is a basal member of Procolophonidae. This clade also includes the enigmatic taxon Sclerosaurus, believed most recently to be a pareiasaur relative. Owenettids form a separate lineage from Procolophonidae and are predominantly restricted to the Permian of both South Africa and Madagascar. A phylogenetically based assessment is considered, in which specialized modern taxa (sand lizards) are compared to their nonfossorial sister clade, allowing for "key innovations" to be identified. A similar comparison between owenettids and procolophonids reveals a number of apparent "key innovations" within procolophonids that are suggestive of a burrowing lifestyle for Procolophon.}},

Among the four discovered specimens of this new armored dinosaur the best preserved is the most complete ankylosaur presently known from the Upper Cretaceous of Europe. Although many cranial characters of Hungarosaurus are not determinable, a preliminary phylogenetic analysis places Hungarosaurus in the Nodosauridae as a basal nodosaurid. Hungarosaurus is clearly distinguishable from Struthiosaurus on the basis of the dorsoventrally wide quadratojugal, the presence of bony protuberances on the quadratojugal and postorbital, the robust mandibular quadrate condyle, and the interpterygoid vacuity. The analysis suggests that Hungarosaurus appears to be more derived than Struthiosaurus, but more primitive than the North American Silvisaurus, Sauropelta, and Pawpawsaurus.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Rhabdodontid ornithopod dinosaurs are characteristic elements of Late Cretaceous European vertebrate faunas and were previously collected from lower Campanian to Maastrichtian continental deposits. Phylogenetic analyses have placed rhabdodontids among basal ornithopods as the sister taxon to the clade consisting of Tenontosaurus, Dryosaurus, Camptosaurus, and Iguanodon. Recent studies considered Zalmoxes, the best known representative of the clade, to be significantly smaller than closely related ornithopods such as Tenontosaurus, Camptosaurus, or Rhabdodon, and concluded that it was probably an island dwarf that inhabited the Maastrichtian Ha\c{t}eg Island. Rhabdodontid remains from the Santonian of western Hungary provide evidence for a new, small-bodied form, which we assign to Mochlodon vorosi n. sp. The new species is most similar to the early Campanian M. suessi from Austria, and the close affinities of the two species is further supported by the results of a global phylogenetic analysis of ornithischian dinosaurs. Bone histological studies of representatives of all rhabdodontids indicate a similar adult body length of 1.6–1.8 m in the Hungarian and Austrian species, 2.4–2.5 m in the subadults of both Zalmoxes robustus and Z. shqiperorum and a much larger, 5–6 m adult body length in Rhabdodon. Phylogenetic mapping of femoral lengths onto the results of the phylogenetic analysis suggests a femoral length of around 340 mm as the ancestral state for Rhabdodontidae, close to the adult femoral lengths known for Zalmoxes (320–333 mm). Our analysis of body size evolution does not support the hypothesis of autapomorhic nanism for Zalmoxes. However, Rhabdodon is reconstructed as having undergone autapomorphic giantism and the reconstructed small femoral length (245 mm) of Mochlodon is consistent with a reduction in size relative to the ancestral rhabdodontid condition. Our results imply a pre-Santonian divergence between western and eastern rhabdodontid lineages within the western Tethyan archipelago.}},

Langbergia modisei gen. et sp. nov. is characterized by circular to ovoid in outline upper postcanines and the absence of a maxillary platform lateral to the postcanine series. Apart from the new taxon, we recognize two other species of this family in the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone: Trirachodon berryi and Cricodon metabolus, the latter also represented in the Tanzanian Manda Formation. A phylogenetic analysis of gomphodont cynodonts was conducted using a data matrix of 43 craniodental characters and 18 terminals. Trirachodontidae appears as a monophyletic assemblage, with Langbergia appearing as the sister taxon of Cricodon. The monophyly of trirachodontids is weakly supported, however, with one extra step breaking it. Traversodontid cynodont relationships were also inspected and compared with a recent phylogeny proposed for this group. Considering the resulting phylogeny and the sudden appearance and diversification of Cynognathia representatives, the origin of basal Cynognathia (i.e. Cynognathus, Diademodon, and trirachodontids) is suggested to predate their first appearance in the fossil record. {\copyright} 2006 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2006, 147, 383–413.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The Traversodontidae is a Triassic family of nonmammalian cynodonts, recorded worldwide, characterized by its bucco-lingually expanded postcanines. A recently discovered fauna in the locality of Santa Cruz do Sul, corresponding to the Santa Maria Formation of the Brazilian Middle/Upper Triassic (Ladinian/Carnian), is made up exclusively of nonmammalian cynodonts with an abundance of traversodontids. A new taxon, Santacruzodon hopsoni gen. et sp. nov., the most commonly recorded traversodontid cynodont in the fauna, is described here. It is diagnosed by an autapomorphy, a very large posterolabial cusp in the upper postcanine, representing more than half of the labial crest, and a suite of traits present in other traversodontids. Among these features are the descendent flange of the jugal developed as a ball-shaped projection, also known in the Madagascan traversodontid Dadadon isaloi, and the presence of symmetrical incisors with numerous mesial and distal marginal cuspules, feature shared with the North American taxon Arctotraversodon plemmyridon. A phylogenetic analysis of traversodontids from Gondwana, based on a data matrix of 28 characters (mostly dental) and 15 terminals (13 traversodontids, including the new species, plus Diademodon and Trirachodon) was performed. The new traversodontid appears as the sister taxon of Dadadon. A monophyletic Carnian group composed of Exaeretodon, Menadon and Scalenodontoides, with the Carnian Gomphodontosuchus, and the Ladinian Massetognathus as successive outgroups is also supported. In line with a recent phylogenetic hypothesis, a nonmonophyletic relationship for Scalenodon'species' from the Anisian Manda beds also results from our analysis. Based on the cladogram obtained, morphological trends of change in the dentition of traversodontids throughout the Triassic are suggested. {\copyright} 2003 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2003, 139, 529−545.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The phylogenetic position of the giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca (Carnivora: Ursidae: Ailuropodinae), has been one of the most hotly debated topics by mammalian biologists and paleontologists during the last century. Based on molecular data, it is currently recognized as a true ursid, sister-taxon of the remaining extant bears, from which it would have diverged by the Early Miocene. However, from a paleobiogeographic and chronological perspective, the origin of the giant panda lineage has remained elusive due to the scarcity of the available Miocene fossil record. Until recently, the genus Ailurarctos from the Late Miocene of China (ca. 8–7 mya) was recognized as the oldest undoubted member of the Ailuropodinae, suggesting that the panda lineage might have originated from an Ursavus ancestor. The role of the purported ailuropodine Agriarctos, from the Miocene of Europe, in the origins of this clade has been generally dismissed due to the paucity of the available material. Here, we describe a new ailuropodine genus, Kretzoiarctos gen. nov., based on remains from two Middle Miocene (ca. 12–11 Ma) Spanish localities. A cladistic analysis of fossil and extant members of the Ursoidea confirms the inclusion of the new genus into the Ailuropodinae. Moreover, Kretzoiarctos precedes in time the previously-known, Late Miocene members of the giant panda clade from Eurasia (Agriarctos and Ailurarctos). The former can be therefore considered the oldest recorded member of the giant panda lineage, which has significant implications for understanding the origins of this clade from a paleobiogeographic viewpoint.}},

Partially articulated and disarticulated cranial material representing two individuals was recovered from the Jones Ranch locality in close association with the sauropod Paluxysaurus jonesi. The holotype skull is nearly complete, missing the premaxillae, left palatine, and pterygoids, and does not preserve the choanal region. This taxon is notable for having its frontal separated medially from the orbital margin, an extremely elongate anterolateral process of the postorbital, large and rounded supratemporal fenestrae, and a narrow, rod-like posterior ramus of the jugal. These features indicate affinities with goniopholidids, pholidosaurids, and thalattosuchians. A phylogenetic analysis places Paluxysuchus newmani deep within Neosuchia as the sister taxon to the clade that includes Goniopholididae and Eusuchia.

  Abstract                 = {{Squaliformes comprise the major proportion of modern deep-water sharks, yet their fossil history and phylogenetic relationships are still poorly understood. New analyses have been undertaken, however, and new living and fossil species have been discovered during the past 10 years. A cladistic analysis involving 29 dental characters has been made and most living and fossil genera are included. On the basis of their dental morphology, the monophyly of the Squaliformes can be supported if the fossil genus Protospinax is excluded. The traditional phylogenetic positions of most living genera, Protosqualus, Cretascymnus and Eoetmopterus, are confirmed despite the fact that the Oxynotidae, Etmopterinae, Palaeomicroides, Proetmopterus and Microetmopterus have some atypical phylogenetic relationships within the Squaliformes. The addition of the palaeontological data in a phylogenetic tree including fossil and living Squaliformes demonstrates some gaps in the fossil record. Nevertheless, and as a consequence of that stratigraphy-phylogeny inference, two particular events can be pinpointed in the history of the Squaliformes: the first one occurs after the major Cenomanian-Turonian anoxic event and the second one after the Cretaceous/Tertiary crisis. The first radiation involves the majority of the living Squaliformes (Somniosinae, Centrophorinae, most of the Etmopterinae, Oxynotinae) in deep-sea waters, the second, the more epipelagic sharks (most of the Dalatiidae), suggesting a secondary adaptation to more shallow environments.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Cladistic analysis of the trilobite subfamily Acanthoparyphinae Whittington and Evitt, 1954, yields an explicit hypothesis of relationship for the group. All Silurian species together form a robustly supported monophylum including the genera Hyrokybe Lane, 1972, Parayoungia Chatterton and Perry, 1984, and Youngia Lindstrom, 1885. Sister to this is the Ordovician type species of Acanthoparypha Whittington and Evitt, 1954. Remaining species that have historically been assigned to either Acanthoparypha or Pandaspinapyga Esker and Levin, 1964, form a rather labile paraphylum. Nevertheless, the entire group thus identified is definitely monophyletic, and supported by several prominent synapomorphic character-states. The basal structure and basal node of the subfamily are more difficult to assess. The relationships of the genera Hammannopyge Pribyl, Vanek, and Pek, 1985, Holia Bradley, 1930, and Nieszkowskia Schmidt, 1881, need to be addressed within the wider context of the family as a whole. The traditional assignment of Holia to the acanthoparyphines is followed. Wenlock acanthoparyphines from the Cape Phillips Formation of the central Canadian Arctic islands include several species of Hyrokybe and Parayoungia. They are similar to, and in one case conspecific with, coeval forms to the southwest in the southern Mackenzie Mountains. Five species are new: Holia glabra, Hyrokybe lightfooti, Hyrokybe youngi, Hyrokybe mitchellae, and Parayoungia mclaughlini. At least four other potentially new species are reported in open nomenclature.}},

Here we describe a new member of the group, Bonapartenykus ultimus gen. et sp. nov. from Campanian–Maastrichtian strata of Northern Patagonia, Argentina. Bonapartenykus is represented by a single, incomplete postcranial skeleton. The morphology of the known skeletal elements suggests close affinities with the previously described taxon from Patagonia, Patagonykus, and both conform to a new clade, here termed Patagonykinae nov. Two incomplete eggs have been discovered in association with the skeletal remains of Bonapartenykus, and several clusters of broken eggshells of the same identity were also found in a close proximity. These belong to the new ooparataxon Arriagadoolithus patagoniensis of the new oofamily Arriagadoolithidae, which provides first insights into unique shell microstructure and fungal contamination of eggs laid by alvarezsaurid theropods. The detailed study of the eggs sheds new light on the phylogenetic position of alvarezsaurids within the Theropoda, and the evolution of eggs among Coelurosauria. We suggest that plesiomorphic alvarezsaurids survived in Patagonia until the latest Cretaceous, whereas these basal forms became extinct elsewhere. \^{a}º The new clade Patagonykinae is established in order to include Patagonykus and the new genus Bonapartenykus. \^{a}º The alvarezsaurid-type eggs is unique and constitutes the ootaxon Arraigadoolithidae. \^{a}º Fossil eggshells indicate the presence of fungal contamination. \^{a}º Basal alvarezsaurids persisted in South America until Latest Cretaceous times.}},

New specimens of Crocodylia from the Urumaco Formation are described and a new species, Purussaurus mirandai, erected. This is characterised by a large, elongate and extremely flat skull, a very large narial opening comprising almost 60\% of rostral length and a large incisive foramen that extends anteriorly between the fossae for the first mandibulary teeth. Purussaurus mirandai sp. nov. was the largest predator in the swampy environments and represented the top trophic level in the Urumaco assemblage. A phylogenetic analysis of 164 characters in 68 ingroup crocodile taxa supported the association of P. neivensis and P. mirandai with five synapomorphies and confirmed the sister?group relationship of the genus with the Nettosuchidae.}},

It possesses a suite of derived characters previously only known from tetrapods, which first appear in the late Devonian (late Frasnian), and a phylogenetic analysis places it on the internode between Panderichthys and the base of the Tetrapoda. The analysis also reveals that the 'Elpistostegalia' are paraphyletic to Tetrapoda, with Elpistostege closer to tetrapods than is Panderichthys. Owing to incompleteness of the material, there is almost no overlap between the data sets for ElpistostegeLivoniana; the analysis places the two genera in an unresolved trichotomy. In addition to the tetrapod features, Livoniana has a strikingly autapomorphic dentary dentition comprising multiple tooth rows.

  Abstract                 = {{The postcranial stem tetrapod remains from Scat Craig include a neural arch, humerus, tibia, femur, and incomplete pectoral girdles and ilia. These elements are all large or very large compared with the corresponding bones of other stem tetrapods. They correlate well in size with the proportions of Elginerpeton, the known stem tetrapod from Scat Craig, and probably belong to this genus. The neural arch has weak zygapophyses, and the ilia and shoulder girdles resemble those of Ichthyostega. The femur is strongly twisted, with the intercondylar fossa facing anteroventrally, so the hind limb probably functioned as a paddle. The tibia is broad, as in Acanthostega and Ichthyostega. The humerus is approximately intermediate in shape between those of osteolepiforms and later stem tetrapods, but seems to have a ventral radial facet like Ichthyostega. Overall, the postcranial bones combine apparent synapomorphies with Ichthyostega and characters which are uniquely primitive among stemgroup tetrapods. This character combination is incongruent. A recently discovered postorbital bone from the site is, strictly speaking, indeterminable but may belong to Elginerpeton; it broadly resembles the postorbitals of Ichthyostega and Acanthostega, and demonstrates that the typical stem tetrapod facial morphology had evolved before the end of the Frasnian.}},

The first dorsal fin support lacks radials, whereas the posterior radials in the second dorsal fin support form a branching structure. In the snout, porolepiforms primitively have two lateral rostral bones on each side, the posterior one corresponds to the ” nariodal” of Jarvik, and the infraorbital canal runs along the suture between this bone and the premaxilla. A cladistic analysis based on 54 characters places the Porolepiformes as sister-group of a clade Powichlhys + Youngolepis + Diabolepis + Dipnoi. The postcranial skeletons of porolepiforms and early lungfishes are very similar, and the skulls of Powichthys, Toungolepis and Diabolepis can be interpreted as forming a transformation series between porolepiform and dipnoan cranial morphologies. Lungfishes thus appear to be derived from 'rhipidistian' ancestors. The porolepiform-lungfish clade is the sister group of another clade containing tetrapods, panderichthyids, osteolepiforms and rhizodonts. Onychodonts and coelacanths are joing unresolved sister groups of the other sarcopterygians. This cladogram is compared with those of other authors, and possible explanations for the differences are discussed. An outline classification of the Sarcopterygii is proposed.}},

Redescriptions are provided for the lower jaws of the elpistostegid Panderichthys, the Devonian tetrapods Elginerpeton, Obruchevichthys, Metaxygnathus, Ventastega and Ichthyostega, and the Carboniferous tetrapods Crassigyrinus, Megalocephalus and Gephyrostegus. The character distri- butions thus revealed differ considerably from previous accounts, particularly in the wide distribution of certain primitive characters. Meckelian ossification in the middle part of the jaw is widespread among Devonian tetrapods, being demonstrably absent only in Acanthostega. Among Carboniferous tetrapods, a tooth-bearing parasymphysial plate is shown to be present in Crassigyrinus and Megalocephalus (having already been demonstrated by other authors in Whatcheeria and Greererpeton). A phylogenetic analysis of 26 early tetrapods including all the aforementioned genera, scored for 51 lower jaw characters, produces at least 2,500 equally parsimonious trees. However, the lack of resolution lies largely in a big top end polychotomy containing anthracosaurs, temnospondyls, seymouriamorphs, microsaurs and a nectridean-amniote clade. Below this polycho- tomy, which may correspond approximately to the tetrapod crown group, there is a well-resolved stem-group containing, in descending order, Megalocephalus, Greererpeton, Crassigyrinus, (jaws associated with) Tulerpeton, Whatcheeria, Acanthostega, Metaxygnathus, Ichthyostega, Ventastega and Metaxygnathus (unresolved), an Elginerpeton-Obruchevichthys clade, and Panderichthys. This conflicts with recently published phylogenies by Coates and Lebedev \& Coates, which place Tulerpeton and all post-Devonian tetrapods in the amphibian or amniote branches of the tetrapod crown group.}},

However, progress has centred on the upper part of the Tetrapodomorpha5 which is occupied by Devonian tetrapods such as Acanthostega 1,2,5 and Ichthyostega 1. Few advances have been made in improving our understanding of the lower, 'fish' part of the group, beyond establishing Elpistostegalia, Osteolepiformes and Rhizodontida as progressively more primitive constituents10, 11, 12, 13. It has not been convincingly confirmed or disproved that the Osteolepiformes, a diverse but structurally uniform group that is central to the debate about tetrapod origins14, 15, 16, 17, is monophyletic relative to tetrapods (that is, a single side branch on the tetrapod lineage). The earliest steps of the fish–tetrapod transition have thus remained poorly resolved. Here we present the first detailed analysis of the lower part of the Tetrapodomorpha, based on 99 characters scored for 29 taxa. We show that both the Osteolepiformes as a whole and their constituent group Osteolepididae are paraphyletic to tetrapods (that is, each comprises a section of the tetrapod lineage with several side branches), and that their 'uniting characters' are attributes of the tetrapodomorph stem lineage. The supposedly discredited idea of osteolepiforms as tetrapod ancestors14, 15, 16, 17 is, in effect, supported by our analysis. Tetrapod-like character complexes evolved three times in parallel within the Tetrapodomorpha.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Although the lungfish (Dipnoi) belong within the Osteichthyes, their dentitions are radically different from other osteichthyans. Lungfish dentitions also show a uniquely high structural disparity during the early evolution of the group, partly owing to the independent variation of odontogenic and odontoclastic processes that are tightly and stereotypically coordinated in other osteichthyans. We present a phylogenetic analysis of early lungfishes incorporating a novel approach to coding these process characters in preference to the resultant adult dental morphology. The results only partially resolve the interrelationships of Devonian dipnoans, but show that the widely discussed hypothesis of separate tooth-plated, dentine-plated, and denticulated lineages is unlikely to be true. The dipnoan status of Diabolepis is corroborated. Lungfish dentitions seem to have undergone extensive and nonparsimonious evolution during the early history of the group, but much of the resulting disparity can be explained by a modest number of evolutionary steps in the underlying developmental processes, those for dental formation (odontogenic) and those for the remodeling of dentine tissue (odontoclastic). Later in lungfish evolution, this disparity was lost as the group settled to a pattern of dental development that is just as stereotypic as, but completely different from, that of other osteichthyans.}},

Systematic opinion regarding the position of Herrerasauridae at the base of Dinosauria has varied. Here we describe a new herrerasaurid, Sanjuansaurus gordilloi gen. n., sp. n., based on a partial skeleton from Carnian-age strata of the the Upper Triassic Ischigualasto Formation of northwestern Argentina. The new taxon is diagnosed by numerous features, including long, band-shaped and posterolaterally oriented transverse process on the posterior cervical vertebrae; neural spines of the sixth to eighth dorsal vertebrae, at least, bearing acute anterior and posterior processes; scapula and coracoid with everted lateral margins of the glenoid; and short pubis (63\% of the femoral length). Phylogenetic analysis placed Sanjuansaurus within a monophyletic Herrerasauridae, at the base of Theropoda and including Herrerasaurus and Staurikosaurus. The presence of Sanjuansaurus at the base of the Ischigualasto Formation, along with other dinosaurs such as Herrerasaurus, Eoraptor, Panphagia, and Chromogisaurus suggests that saurischian dinosaurs in southwestern Pangea were already widely diversified by the late Carnian rather than increasing in diversity across the Carnian-Norian boundary.}},

Ferganasaurus forms an unresolved polytomy with neosauropods Jobaria, Diplodocoidea (Nemegtosauridae, Rebbachisauridae, Diplodocidae, and Dicraeosauridae), and Macronaria (Camarasaurus, Haplocan-thosaurus and Titanosauriformes). The neosauropod characters of Ferganasaurus include five coossified sacral vertebra, metacarpal proximal ends subtriangular, composite proximal articular surface of metacarpus U-shaped, tibia with sub-circular proximal end, astragalar ascending process extends to the posterior margin of the astragalus, and astragalus wedge-shaped in anterior view. Ferganasaurus is one of the oldest known neosauropods, and possesses two primitive characters unusual for a neosauropod (femur shaft with sigmoid curve, and fourth trochanter of the femur blade-like with acuminate apex).}},

The morphology of their crocodile-like skull, stomach contents, and oxygen isotopic composition of the bones suggest they had a predominantly piscivorous diet. Even if close relationships between spinosaurids and Middle Jurassic megalosaurs seem well established, very little is known about the transition from a generalized large basal tetanuran to the specialized morphology of spinosaurids. Spinosaurid remains were previously known from the Early to Late Cretaceous of North Africa, Europe, and South America. Here, we report the discovery of a new spinosaurid theropod from the late Early Cretaceous Savannakhet Basin in Laos, which is distinguished by an autapomorphic sinusoidal dorsosacral sail. This new taxon, Ichthyovenator laosensis gen. et sp. nov., includes well-preserved and partially articulated postcranial remains. Although possible spinosaurid teeth have been reported from various Early Cretaceous localities in Asia, the new taxon I. laosensis is the first definite record of Spinosauridae from Asia. Cladistic analysis identifies Ichthyovenator as a member of the sub-clade Baryonychinae and suggests a widespread distribution of this clade at the end of the Early Cretaceous. Chilantaisaurus tashouikensis from the Cretaceous of Inner Mongolia, and an ungual phalanx from the Upper Jurassic of Colorado are also referred to spinosaurids, extending both the stratigraphical and geographical range of this clade.}},

  Abstract                 = {{—Continuous track analysis (CTA) can depict reticulate evolutionary patterns in phylogenetics and biogeography. A reticulate connection implies convergence, hybridization, or introgression in an evolutionary graph of taxa and implies dispersal in an evolutionary graph of biogeographic areas. CTA finds graphs that (1) have a minimal number of connections and (2) imply that most character states or taxa have distributions or tracks across taxa or areas (objects) that are continuous, i.e., can be traced across the connections among the objects including that state without traveling through any other objects. Continuous tracks imply either that character states in phylogenies have unique evolutionary origins or that taxa in biogeographic analyses are monophyletic. Relatively simple graphs usually cannot imply completely continuous tracks. Therefore, CTA graphs seek to minimize the number of track fragments, which are locally continuous parts of a track; tracks with more than one fragment are discontinuous. Minimizing fragments is the same as minimizing character-state transitions only if there are no reticulations. Because hypothetical ancestors do little to reduce the number of fragments, CTA tends to place known taxa or areas at internal nodes. A heuristic algorithm analogous to tree bisection-reconnection is used to find highly parsimonious CTA graphs. In phylogenetic analyses, CTA employs a special complementary binary coding convention that serendipitously solves the missing characters/missing data problem. Although the problem of ancestors ” inheriting” states from hybrid descendants is irrelevant if reticulations merely represent convergence patterns, CTA includes an optional algorithm that avoids such instances by explicitly identifying ancestors and descendants. CTA was compared with standard parsimony analysis using a data set of 17 Neogene species of North American fossil hipparionine horses. CTA separates the three major clades and illustrates their. convergent features with reticulations, whereas standard parsimony analysis groups the three in an unresolved polytomy. CTA also minimizes the number of hypothetical, unsampled ancestors and lineages.}},

Quetzalichthys perrilliatae is characterized by three unique characters: 26 abdominal centra, 21 principal dorsal fin rays, and two supraorbitals. Additionally, its unpaired fins and tail show conditions intermediate to those found in Ionoscopus and Oshunia. A cladistic analysis of Ionoscopiformes, including both taxa found in the Tlay\'{u}a Quarry (Quetzalichthys and Teoichthys), identifies two monophyletic families within the order, Ophiopsidae (including Ophiopsis, Macrepistius, Teoichthys) and Ionoscopidae (involving Ionoscopus, Oshunia, and Quetzalichthys).}},

Our results, using phylogenetic methodology in conjunction with traditional methods, showed a more complete and easily testable picture of this evolution than either method used alone. A detailed working hypothesis of athyridide phylogeny and the supporting evidence on character distribution is given, and a new classification of the impunctate and punctate athyrids sensu lato is presented with diagnoses to subfamily. Agreement between the stratigraphical first appearance of athyridid subfamilies and their cladistic rank was quite good (except for the koninckinoids), suggesting that both outgroup and traditional paleontological methods indicate a similar direction of character polarity in the evolution of the group. The classification is proposed based on a mix of external and internal characters which persisted during unbroken lineages. New taxa are the families Parazygidae and Triathyrididae; the subfamilies Whitfieldellinae, Triathyridinae, Septathyridinae, Cleiothyridininae, Ochotathyridinae and Plectospirinae, and the genera Brimethyris, Carteridina, Tetraloba and Cooperispira.

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract Chimaerastacus pacifluvialis, new genus and species, is established on the basis of fossils from the Middle Triassic Liard Formation of northeastern British Columbia. It has well-defined cervical, postcervical, and branchiocardiac grooves; three longitudinal ridges on the cephalic region; and true chelae on the first through third pereiopods. The morphological features of the carapace are a combination of traits used to define both the erymids and the glypheids. A cladistic analysis of 31 decapod genera defines the Astacidea as a monophyletic group, supports the inclusion of the Glypheoidea within the infraorder Astacidea, illustrates the relationships of the Glypheoidea with other astacid groups, and suggests erection of a new family, the Chimaerastacidae, for our new genus and species of decapod. Specimens of C. pacifluvialis are preserved in a sandy bioclastic floatstone that was deposited near the Peace River Embayment in the Middle Triassic. The host lithology suggests that the decapods inhabited a transitional environment between low relief biostromes and the shoreface. This environment provided a unique set of conditions that allowed exceptional preservation of the decapod material.}},

This study takes the first step toward defining the relationships of Laurentian taxa within this group using cladistic methods. Parillaenus Jaanusson, 1954 forms a monophyletic group based on pygidial morphology that is distinct from Illaenus. Our analysis indicates that Illaenus is paraphyletic and requires major revision. Thaleops is a large group of species whose monophyly is supported by an unambiguous apomorphy: the presence of long articulating facets on the pygidium that are oriented at a high angle to the anterior margin of the pygidium. All but one basal member of the clade possesses a second apomorphy, posteriorly positioned palpebral lobes. Nanillaenus is not monophyletic and is synonymised with Thaleops. Several Laurentian species originally identified as Illaenus are reassigned to Thaleops. Seventeen previously named species are revised and re-illustrated, four of which (I. arcturus Hall, 1847; I. clavifrons Billings, 1859; I. punctatus Raymond, 1905; I. americanus Billings, 1859) are restricted to the type material. In addition, four new species, T. anusacerbissima, T. jaanussoni, T. mobydicki and T. laurentiana, are described from the Middle and Upper Ordovician Bromide and Viola Springs formations of Oklahoma and the Trenton Group of New York.}},

This controversy continues into the 21st century, with recently raised doubts about the interpretation of Tetraceratops as the oldest known therapsid, a hypothesis supported by the only redescription of this fossil in the second half of the 20th century. Our study examines the arguments proposed to refute therapsid affinities, and concludes that Tetraceratops indeed is the sister-group of all other known therapsids. The most recently published phylogenetic data matrix that includes Tetraceratops fails to confirm its therapsid affinities. However, adding seven characters to that matrix leads to the conclusion that Tetraceratops is the basal-most and oldest therapsid. The recent suggestion of a Laurasian origin of therapsids appears poorly supported; too few data are available on the distribution of Permian synapsids to settle this question.}},

Pyozia is a basal varanopid similar to Archaeovenator in having teeth that lack lateral compression or serration, lacking a caniniform tooth or region on the maxilla, and possessing four premaxillary teeth. Pyozia uniquely possesses a medial contact of the maxilla with the quadratojugal with no lateral exposure allowing the jugal to form part of the skull's ventral margin, and rounded interpterygoid vacuities just anterior to the basipterygoid articulations. Phylogenetic analysis places Pyozia as sister taxon to the terminal dichotomy of Mycterosaurinae and Varanodontinae. The newly described Upper Carboniferous Archaeovenator is again found to be the most basal varanopid. The Permian saw a large-scale changeover of the synapsid fauna, with derived, but ecologically similar, taxa, replacing more primitive ” pelycosaurs.” Leaf-shaped tooth-bearing caseids were replaced in the Middle and Late Permian by herbivorous pareiasaurs with similar dentition, and Edaphosaurus was replaced by therapsids capable of processing plant material. The large predators of Sphenacodontidae were similarly replaced by therapsid predators. The small to medium sized predator niche, however, was continuously occupied by varanopids. The discovery of the basal Pyozia suggests that varanopids maintained their diversity in the Middle Permian.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The origin of extant amphibians (Lissamphibia: frogs, salamanders and caecilians) is one of the most controversial questions in vertebrate evolution, owing to large morphological and temporal gaps in the fossil record1, 2, 3. Current discussions focus on three competing hypotheses: a monophyletic origin within either Temnospondyli4, 5, 6, 7 or Lepospondyli8, 9, 10, or a polyphyletic origin with frogs and salamanders arising among temnospondyls and caecilians among the lepospondyls11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Recent molecular analyses are also controversial, with estimations for the batrachian (frog–salamander) divergence significantly older than the palaeontological evidence supports17, 18. Here we report the discovery of an amphibamid temnospondyl from the Early Permian of Texas that bridges the gap between other Palaeozoic amphibians and the earliest known salientians19, 20 and caudatans21 from the Mesozoic. The presence of a mosaic of salientian and caudatan characters in this small fossil makes it a key taxon close to the batrachian (frog and salamander) divergence. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the batrachian divergence occurred in the Middle Permian, rather than the late Carboniferous as recently estimated using molecular clocks18, 22, but the divergence with caecilians corresponds to the deep split between temnospondyls and lepospondyls, which is congruent with the molecular estimates.}},

  Abstract                 = {{We used 24 fossil and Recent species to construct character states of both composite and exemplar taxa for phylogenetic analyses of Neogene genera and subgenera of the Corbulidae from tropical America. All characters were conchologic and two matrices, which differed in the manner that commarginal-rib characters were coded, were analyzed using branch and bound searches and maximum parsimony. Character polarity was determined using Corbula sensu strictu as an outgroup. These analyses produced a limited number of robust and well-resolved cladograms that require only one ghost lineage. Such stable results indicate a high level of congruency among characters, and demonstrate that conchologic data sets can yield highly resolved cladograms. Tropical American corbulids are not monophyletic, and include two major clades. Crown groups within these clades are endemic, and all genera endemic to tropical America first appear in the Miocene. In fact, generic diversity and body size peak in the upper Miocene of the Caribbean/western Atlantic. Range restrictions and extinctions of large-bodied genera from both corbulid clades contribute to a post-Miocene decline in body size in this region. The eastern Pacific does not experience a similar decline in diversity and body size. Diversity and morphologic trends in Caribbean corbulids coincide with regional environmental changes, in particular decreases in seasonality and productivity. Except for the extinction of Bothrocorbula, however, corbulid extinctions apparently predate faunal turnover reported for other molluscs. Associated with these extinctions, we found evidence of geographic range restriction, but not range shifts, in corbulid genera, indicating that the geologic development of environmental refugia contributed more to survival than eurytopy. Large-bodied genera of the southern Caribbean Gatunian Province (Tenuicorbula, Panamicorbula, and Hexacorbula) became restricted to the eastern Pacific. Range restriction to this high productivity refugium (i.e., paciphilic genera), rather than origination of new taxa, produced several corbulid genera now endemic to the region. Large-bodied genera from the Caloosahatchian Province of the southeastern U.S. (Bothrocorbula and Bicorbula), however, underwent global extinction. These subtropical and warm temperate taxa are presumably more eurytopic than their tropical counterparts, but do not exhibit range shifts in response to Neogene environmental change. 10.1666/0022-3360(2003)077<1086:EAPRON>2.0.CO;2}},

Pterosaurs from this unit are the earliest and only records of pterosaurs in the Jurassic of northwest China. The individual specimen is one of the largest known among rhamphorhynchoids, or non-pterodactyloid pterosaurs. The holotype comprises an associated skeleton of mostly disarticulated, largely three-dimensional material. Although partly crushed, the preservation in this specimen reveals morphology rarely seen in non-pterodactyloid pterosaurs. This includes a distinct cervical intervertebral articulation morphology that is proposed to be widespread among the non-pterodactyloids. The skull of this new specimen is most similar to that of other rhamphorhynchids, <i>Angustinaripterus longicephalus</i> and <i>Harpactognathus gentryii</i>, found in terrestrial deposits. A phylogenetic analysis of 18 non-pterodactyloid pterosaurs and the Pterodactyloidea places <i>Sericipterus wucaiwanensis</i> with these species within the Rhamphorhynchinae and a monophyletic Rhamphorhynchidae. Unlike previous phylogenetic analyses, the Dimorphodontidae is paraphyletic, the Campylognathoididae is polyphyletic, and the Anurognathidae is the sister group of the Pterodactyloidea. <i>Sericipterus wucaiwanensis</i>, <i>Angustinaripterus longicephalus</i>, <i>Harpactognathus gentryii</i> represent a clade of large pterosaurs that likely lived in the terrestrial settings in which they preserved.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The largest known flying organisms are the azhdarchid pterosaurs, a pterodactyloid clade previously diagnosed by the characters of their extremely elongate middle-series cervical vertebrae. The named species of the Azhdarchidae are from the Late Cretaceous. However, isolated mid-cervical vertebrae with similar dimensions and characters have been referred to this group that date back to the Late Jurassic, implying an almost 60 million year gap in the fossil record of this group and an unrecorded radiation in the Jurassic of all the major clades of the Pterodactyloidea. A new pterosaur from the Early Cretaceous of Liaoning Province of China, Elanodactylus prolatus gen. et sp. nov., is described with mid-cervical vertebrae that bear these azhdarchid characters but has other postcranial material that are distinct from the members of this group. Phylogenetic analysis of the new species and the Pterodactyloidea places it with the Late Jurassic vertebrae in the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous Ctenochasmatidae and reveals that the characters of the elongate azhdarchid vertebrae appeared independently in both groups. These results are realized though the large taxon sampling in the analysis demonstrating that the homoplastic character states present in these two taxa were acquired in a different order in their respective lineages. Some of these homoplastic characters were previously thought to appear once in the history of pterosaurs and may be correlated to the extension of the neck regions in both groups. Because the homoplastic character states in the Azhdarchidae and Ctenochasmatidae are limited to the mid-cervical vertebrae, these states are termed convergent based on a definition of the term in a phylogenetic context. A number of novel results from the analysis presented produce a reorganization in the different species and taxa of the Pterodactyloidea.}},

No additional specimens have been referred to the species since its erection. Two new specimens of <i>C. parringtoni</i>, which were collected from the Kawinga Formation in 1933, are described. The holotype and new specimens share tusks, the absence of postcanine teeth, a shortened snout, relatively large palatines that contact the premaxillary secondary palate, a blade-like mid-ventral vomerine plate, and an intertuberal ridge between the basisphenoid-basioccipital tubera. The new specimens also allow the description of many previously unknown characters of the species, including an intertemporal region in which the postorbitals extensively overlap the parietals but are relatively horizontally oriented for most of their width; the presence of paired anterior palatal ridges; the absence of a labial fossa; the presence of palatine pads that are rugose posteriorly, but smoother where they contact the secondary palate; the presence of a dorsal process on the anterior end of the epipterygoid footplate; markedly shortened dentary tables; the presence of a posterior dentary sulcus; and the presence of a slit-like mandibular fenestra. Size and proportional differences between the holotype and new specimens suggest that the former is a juvenile. The morphology of the new specimens demonstrates that <i>C. parringtoni</i> is not part of <i>Cryptocynodon, Pristerodon, or Diictodon</i>, and the species is referred to a new taxon, <i>Katumbia</i>, gen. nov. A phylogenetic analysis suggests that <i>Katumbia</i> is a member of the large clade that includes <i>Tropidostoma</i> and <i>Kannemeyeria</i>, although its exact position within the clade is uncertain. Confirmation that <i>Katumbia parringtoni</i>, comb. nov., is a distinct, valid dicynodont species that is endemic to Tanzania reinforces the uniqueness of the Ruhuhu fauna and provides further evidence of provinciality among Late Permian terrestrial vertebrates.}},

The genus is characterized by a two autapomorphies, elongate nasal bosses and a concave dorsal surface of the snout; it also possesses wide exposure of the parietals on the intertemporal skull roof, the presence of a postcaniniform crest, the absence of a labial fossa, and the presence of a dorsal process on the anterior ramus of the epipterygoid footplate. In addition, newly recognized specimens collected in South Africa extend the known geographic range of the genus and allow description of the humerus and scapula for the first time. Cladistic analysis of a data set including Odontocyclops and 18 other well-known South African dicynodont genera does not support the hypothesis that Odontocyclops is a close relative of Dicynodon or of Triassic dicynodonts such as Kannemeyeria. Instead, a close relationship with Oudenodon and Rhachiocephalus is proposed. The presence of Odontocyclops in South Africa and Zambia makes it potentially valuable for more precise biostratigraphic correlation between the sediments of the Karoo Basin and the Luangwa Valley.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Dicynodont therapsids have been known from the Upper Permian of Eastern Europe since the beginning of the twentieth century, but the phylogenetic relationships of these taxa have not been examined cladistically. Here we present the results of a phylogenetic analysis that includes eight Permian dicynodonts from Russia as well as 18 taxa best known from southern Africa. Our results do not conflict with much of the established picture of Permian dicynodont phylogeny, but are consistent with several novel hypotheses. Most importantly, our analysis suggests that the genus Dicynodon is paraphyletic, and we question its use in correlating widely separated basins. However, we cannot strongly reject a monophyletic Dicynodon. Our results also indicate that the closest Permian relatives of Kannemeyeria lived in Russia, suggesting a Laurasian origin for the lineage that includes this important Triassic taxon. The phylogeny presented here also suggests a Laurasian origin for several other dicynodont clades, but a Gondwanan origin is equally likely given the data at hand. Regardless of where these groups originated, there appears to be some endemism among Late Permian dicynodont faunas. Although our understanding of dicynodont phylogeny is improving, this study emphasizes the disparity in sampling of the dicynodont record between Gondwana and Laurasia and the need for a large scale phylogenetic analysis of Permian and Triassic dicynodonts.\&\#8195;\&\#169; 2003 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2003, 139, 157\&\#8722;212.}},

Diagnostic characters of P. dubei include postorbitals that slope ventrolaterally and overlap the parietals nearly completely; median anterior palatal ridges that converge with the posterior median palatal ridge, forming a V-shaped structure; caniniform process with an anterior edge that is set off from the palatal rim forming a notch; 'postcanine' teeth present on the maxilla; a ventrally directed transverse flange of the pterygoid with an obtuse posterior margin; a short interpterygoid vacuity that does not reach the level of the palatine pads; a dentary table that forms an elongate grooved surface on the dorsal surface of the dentary, bounded laterally by a low ridge and medially by a tall, thin, dorsally convex blade; 'postcanine' teeth present on the dentary blade; and the absence of a posterior dentary sulcus. A phylogenetic analysis confirms that P. dubei is a member of Pylaecephalidae, although we cannot corroborate that it is the sister taxon of Diictodon feliceps. The holotype of P. dubei was collected low in the Tapinocephalus Assemblage Zone in the northwestern Karoo Basin, near the contact between the Ecca and Beaufort groups, within the stratigraphic range of Robertia but above the ranges of Eodicynodon and Colobodectes. On-going research suggests dicynodonts in the Tapinocephalus Assemblage Zone appeared in sequence (Colobodectes first; Lanthanostegus, Robertia, Prosictodon second; Diictodon and Pristerodon third), in contrast to earlier works that portrayed Diictodon, Robertia, and Pristerodon as occurring throughout the zone.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Argentinean basal sauropodomorphs are known by several specimens from different basins; Ischigualasto, El Tranquilo, and Mogna. The Argentinean record is diverse and includes some of the most primitive known sauropodomorphs such as Panphagia and Chromogisaurus, as well as more derived forms, including several massospondylids. Until now, the Massospondylidae were the group of basal sauropodomorphs most widely spread around Pangea with a record in almost all continents, mostly from the southern hemisphere, including the only record from Antarctica. We describe here a new basal sauropodomorph, Leyesaurus marayensis gen. et sp. nov., from the Quebrada del Barro Formation, an Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic unit that crops out in northwestern Argentina. The new taxon is represented by a partial articulated skeleton that includes the skull, vertebral column, scapular and pelvic girdles, and hindlimb. Leyesaurus is diagnosed by a set of unique features, such as a sharply acute angle (50 degrees) formed by the ascending process of the maxilla and the alveolar margin, a straight ascending process of the maxilla with a longitudinal ridge on its lateral surface, noticeably bulging labial side of the maxillary teeth, greatly elongated cervical vertebrae, and proximal articular surface of metatarsal III that is shelf-like and medially deflected. Phylogenetic analysis recovers Leyesaurus as a basal sauropodomorph, sister taxon of Adeopapposaurus within the Massospondylidae. Moreover, the results suggest that massospondylids achieved a higher diversity than previously thought. Our phylogenetic results differ with respect to previous analyses by rejecting the massospondylid affinities of some taxa from the northern hemisphere (e.g., Seitaad, Sarahsaurus). As a result, the new taxon Leyesaurus, coupled with other recent discoveries, suggests that the diversity of massospondylids in the southern hemisphere was higher than in other regions of Pangea. Finally, the close affinities of Leyesaurus with the Lower Jurassic Massospondylus suggest a younger age for the Quebrada del Barro Formation than previously postulated.}},

New postrcanial remains of Coloradisaurus brevis, the most gracile sauropodomorph from this unit, are described here and evaluated within a phylogenetic context. These materials belong to a single individual and include elements of the vertebral column, pectoral girdle, incomplete forelimb, pelvis and hindlimb. These elements share an autapomorphic feature with the type specimen of Coloradisaurus brevis and provide novel and unique features that diagnose this taxon, such as pubic apron with semicircular cross-section and with a depression on its anterior surface, distal surface of the tibia deflected and facing posterodistally and well-developed pyramidal dorsal process of the posteromedial corner of the astragalus. Several postcranial characters of Coloradisaurus are exclusively shared with Lufengosaurus, from the Lower Jurassic of China. The inclusion of this information in two recent phylogenetic data sets depicts Coloradisaurus as closely related to Lufengosaurus and well nested within Plateosauria. Both data sets used indicate strong character support for the inclusion of Coloradisaurus and Lufengosaurus within Massospondylidae.}},

The new taxon, consisting of a complete dentary, is ascribed to Sphenodontia based on the presence of a deep and wide Meckelian groove, long posterior process, well-developed coronoid process, and acrodont teeth showing dental regionalization including successional, alternate hatchling, and additional series. This allocation is reinforced by a phylogenetic analysis that places the new taxon in a basal position within a clade of sphenodontians that excludes Diphydontosaurus and Planocephalosaurus. Additionally, the new taxon clusters within a Gondwanan clade with the Indian Godavarisaurus from the Jurassic Kota Formation, sharing the presence of recurved and relatively large posterior successional teeth that are ribbed and bear a peculiar anterolingual groove. This sister-group relationship is intriguing from a palaeobiogeographical viewpoint, as it suggests some degree of endemism during the initial stages of the breakup of Pangaea. We also discuss the ontogenetic stage of the new taxon and provide insights on the evolution of successional dentition in rhynchocephalians. {\copyright} 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2012, 166, 342–360.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Sphenodontian reptiles successfully radiated during Triassic and Jurassic times, but were driven almost to extinction during the Cretaceous period1. The sparse Early Cretaceous record of sphenodontians has been interpreted as reflecting the decline of the group in favour of lizards, their suspected ecological successors2. However, recent discoveries in Late Cretaceous beds in Patagonia partially modify this interpretation. Numerous skeletons of a new sphenodontian, Priosphenodon avelasi gen. et sp. nov., were collected from a single locality in the Cenomanian–Turonian Candeleros Formation, where it is more abundant than any other tetrapod group recorded in the quarry (for example, Crocodyliformes, Serpentes, Dinosauria and Mammalia)3, 4. Adult specimens of Priosphenodon reached one metre in length, larger than any previously known terrestrial sphenodontian. Here we propose, using available evidence, that sphenodontians were not a minor component of the Cretaceous terrestrial ecosystems of South America, and that their ecological replacement by squamates was delayed until the early Tertiary. The new discovery helps to bridge the considerable gap in the fossil record (around 120 million years) that separates the Early Cretaceous sphenodontians5, 6, 7 from their living relatives (Sphenodon).}},

We provide a detailed redescription of this material as well as comparisons with other ankylosaurid specimens referred to E. tutus. The synonymy of the genus with Euoplocephalus is not supported, and Dyoplosaurus is a valid taxon. It is possible that the fragmentary nature of the holotype of Euoplocephalus leads to the inference that the diversity of Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids is lower than it actually is. As such, it might be necessary to look beyond traditional cranial characters in order to accurately appraise the number and nature of various ankylosaurid taxa.}},

Euoplocephalus is unusual compared to other dinosaurs from the Late Cretaceous of Alberta because it is recognized from the Dinosaur Park, Horseshoe Canyon, and Two Medicine formations. A comprehensive review of material attributed to Euoplocephalus finds support for the resurrection of its purported synonyms Anodontosaurus lambei and Scolosaurus cutleri, and the previously resurrected Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus. Anodontosaurus is found primarily in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta and is characterized by ornamentation posterior to the orbits and on the first cervical half ring, and wide, triangular knob osteoderms. Euoplocephalus is primarily found in Megaherbivore Assemblage Zone 1 in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta and is characterized by the absence of ornamentation posterior to the orbits and on the first cervical half ring, and keeled medial osteoderms on the first cervical half ring. Scolosaurus is found primarily in the Two Medicine Formation of Montana (although the holotype is from Dinosaur Provincial Park), and is characterized by long, back-swept squamosal horns, ornamentation posterior to the orbit, and low medial osteoderms on the first cervical half ring; Oohkotokia horneri is morphologically indistinguishable from Scolosaurus cutleri. Dyoplosaurus was previously differentiated from Euoplocephalus sensu lato by the morphology of the pelvis and pes, and these features also differentiate Dyoplosaurus from Anodontosaurus and Scolosaurus; a narrow tail club knob is probably also characteristic for Dyoplosaurus.}},

This taxon, plus all extinct taxa that share a more recent common ancestor with placentals than they do with Metatheria (including marsupials), constitute Eutheria1. The oldest well documented eutherian-dominated fauna in the world is Dzharakuduk, Uzbekistan2. Among eutherians that it yields is Kulbeckia, an 85–90-Myr-old member of Zalambdalestidae (a family of Late Cretaceous Asian eutherians)3. This extends Zalambdalestidae back by some 10 million years from sites in the Gobi Desert, Mongolia4. A phylogenetic analysis of well described Late Cretaceous eutherians strongly supports Zalambdalestidae, less strongly supports 'Zhelestidae' (a Late Cretaceous clade related to Tertiary ungulates), but does not support Asioryctitheria (a group of Late Cretaceous Asian eutherians). A second analysis incorporating placentals from clades that include rodents (Tribosphenomys), lagomorphs (Mimotona) and archaic ungulates (Protungulatum and Oxyprimus) strongly supports Zalambdalestidae in a clade with Glires (rabbits, rodents and extinct relatives) and less strongly 'Zhelestidae' within a clade that includes archaic ungulates ('condylarths'). This argues that some Late Cretaceous eutherians belong within the crown group Placentalia. The ages of these taxa are in line with molecularly based estimates of 64–104 Myr ago (median 84 Myr ago) for the superordinal diversification of some placentals5, but provide no support for a Late Cretaceous diversification of extant placental orders.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Homoplasy in the evolutionary process takes place when the origin of a character state among lineages occurs more than once, either through parallel or convergent derivation of an apomorphic state from a plesiomorphic state (not necessarily the same sequence in each lineage) or by reversal from an apomorphic to a plesiomorphic state. Such a process can be termed evolutionary homoplasy. In phylogenetic analysis, a transformation series among the observed character states is first hypothesized. Homoplasy is inferred by examining the distribution of character states among extant taxa and determining whether or not this distribution can be explained by single changes between plesiomorphic states and relatively apomorphic states based on the hypothesized transformation series, or whether multiple parallel or convergent changes or reversals are required. Because the actual transformations among the states are not observed, instances of evolutionary homoplasy cannot be inferred. Instead, the principle of parsimony is used to determine the minimum number of character transformations that must be assumed or hypothesized in order to explain the distribution of character states. Whenever the minimum number of necessary steps required by the transformation series is exceeded, homoplasy is inferred to have occurred. The number of steps on most parsimonious trees beyond the minimum can be termed cladistic or phylogenetic homoplasy to differentiate it from evolutionary homoplasy. The latter will always be underestimated by cladistic homoplasy. All references to homoplasy in the following text refer explicitly to cladistic homoplasy.}},

  Abstract                 = {A model of evolutationarily uninformative data is derived and two separate character state distributions, one with two states (0, 1) and one with missing-value data (0, 1, {0, 1}), are obtained. The expectation of number of steps on random trees is derived for both types of data and the variance in number of steps is derived for missing-value data. It is conjectured that the number of steps on random trees for these data should be asymptotically normal. Computer simulation is used to find approximations for the expected number and variance in number of steps of minimum length trees for both types of random evolutionary data. In both cases, minimum length trees are shorter than random trees and, although the lengths diverge in number, they converge in proportion. The length of minimum length trees is frequently used to evaluate the goodness of the tree as a representation of the data and the goodness of the data for constructing a plausible hypothesis of evolutionary relationships. In turn, as the length of a minimum length tree increases, confidence in the resulting tree decreases. The distributions of lengths of minimum length trees are of interest to determine if any information on phylogenetic branching is present in the data. The expected length of random trees can be used as a measure to compare to the lengths of minimum length trees for real data sets.},

  Abstract                 = {{10.2307/2992286 Comparative systematic studies may use different sets of data or different sets of taxa to evaluate the quality of phylogenetic data and phylogenetic hypotheses based on levels of homoplasy as implied by the length of minimum length trees. For comparisons involving diverse arrays of characters and taxa, an appropriate index is required to permit comparisons. Examination of the number of steps per character (NSC) on minimum length trees for 28 data sets revealed a highly significant positive correlation between NSC and the number of taxa and, concomitantly, a highly significant negative correlation between the consistency index (CI) of Kluge and Farris (1969) and the number of taxa. Theoretical expectations from a study of the number of steps on random and minimum length trees (Archie and Felsenstein, 1989) agree with this finding. Computer simulations using randomly selected subsets of taxa and characters from the Drosophila data set of Throckmorton (1968) revealed a similar finding. The latter two studies also revealed a negative relationship between the CI and the number of characters in a study. These findings imply that the CI is not an appropriate index of homoplasy for comparative taxonomic studies. A new index, the homoplasy excess ratio (HER), is introduced that takes into account the expected increase in overall homoplasy levels with increasing numbers of taxa in systematic studies. The properties of HER are examined for the 28 data sets taken from the literature and, in conjunction with the simulations using the Drosophila data set, HER is shown to be more appropriate than CI in comparative taxonomic studies that wish to measure the average level of homoplasy in data sets involving different groups of taxa or different characters. Because HER is a computationally intensive statistic to calculate, two estimates are derived and examined. These estimates, the random expected homoplasy excess ratio (REHER) and the homoplasy excess ratio minimum (HERM), can be easily calculated from the formulas of Archie and Felsenstein (1989) and from intrinsic properties of the data matrix, respectively. HERM is shown to be a better estimator of HER and a linear regression equation is derived to estimate HER from HERM.}},

Parsimony-based character analysis is completed first on Arenig crinoids and then for Arenig and Llanvirn crinoids combined. The topology from well-resolved trees of this early crinoid radiation indicates that the Crinoidea should be subdivided into six subclasses. A new subclass and new order, Aethocrinea and Aethocrinida, respectively, are proposed for crinoids with four circlets of plates in the aboral cup: lintels, infrabasals, basals, and radials. This aboral cup construction is best displayed by Aethocrinus, one of the oldest known crinoids (?Tremadoc-Arenig). However, this primitive aboral cup construction is also present in two Llanvirn crinoids, Perittocrinus and Tetracionocrinus. The Aethocrinea was a small, short-lived radiation of crinoids with this design that was different from those of other crinoids. Two families in the Aethocrinida are the Aethocrinidae, which includes Aethocrinus, and the Perittocrinidae, which includes Perittocrinus and Tetracionocrinus. In addition to the Aethocrinea, the following crinoid subclasses are recognized based on character analyses of these earliest crinoids: Cladida, Camerata, Disparida, Flexibilia, and Articulata.}},

Psittacosaurus sibiricus differs from nine other species of the genus by a unique combination of 32 diagnostic characters, six of which are autapomorphies of the species: small in?fratemporal fenestra, anteroposteriorly short premaxilla, short medial process of postorbital, deep cleft for qaudratojugal on jugal, extending to the posterior side of jugal horn, angular with prominent tuber and 23 presacrals. Psittacosaurus sibiricus is the sister species of P. sinensis, with which it shares the prominent pyramidal laterally projecting jugal horn, but more derived than the latter in having more developed palpebral and postorbital horns. The three lateral foramina on the exoc?cipital/opisthotic are interpreted as exits for cranial nerves X+XI, XII1+2 and XII3, in contrast with previous interpretations. Cranial nerve IX exits the brain cavity through the metotic fissure. Most Psittacosaurus localities are confined to lacustrine deposits and this animal undoubtedly inhabited areas around the great lakes widely distributed in Central Asia during the Early Cretaceous. The age of the Psittacosaurus biochron is estimated as Hauterivian?Albian.}},

The taxon is represented by c. 300 bones that were found associated with large fossilized tree trunks and were collected from the interface of sandstone and mudstone units covering an area of c. 276 m2. The collection includes one partial skeleton; most of the remainder of the bones were disarticulated, disassociated and dispersed, but taphonomic analysis permits recognition of associated elements comprising several individuals. Skeletal anatomy of Barapasaurus includes several teeth, vertebrae from the caudal cervicals rearward to the terminal caudals, and most elements of the appendicular skeleton. Barapasaurus is characterized by spoon-shaped teeth with bulbous bases and grooves on the anterolabial and posterolingual sides of the crown, coarse tubercles on the carina, acamerate cranial and dorsal vertebrae, lateral laminae of the middle and caudal dorsal neural spines composed of spinodiapophyseal and spinopostzygapophyseal laminae, neural canal of the mid-dorsal vertebrae opens dorsally through a narrow slit into a large cavity and sacrum with four co-ossified vertebrae. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that Barapasaurus is basal in comparison with Vulcanodon and is removed from Eusauropoda.}},

Guarinisuchus munizi, the most complete member of this group collected in South America so far, is closely related to the African forms, and this fact suggests that dyrosaurids had crossed the Atlantic Ocean before the K-P boundary and dispersed from there to North America and other parts of South America. This discovery also suggests that on the coast of northeastern Brazil, dyrosaurids replaced the pre-existing Late Cretaceous fauna of diversified mosasaurs, a group of marine lizards, after the K-P extinction event, becoming the main predators, together with sharks, in shallow marine Palaeocene environments. More detailed stratigraphic records and detailed dating of the deposits with dyrosaurids are necessary to correlate this particular pattern found in the ancient northeastern Brazilian coast within the evolution of the group, especially in Africa.}},

Here, we present a detailed re-description of the skull of Lufengosaurus huenei Young. 1941a. from the Lower Lufeng Formation (Lower Jurassic) of China. Lufengosaurus can be diagnosed on the basis of four cranial autapomorphies (the presence of bony bosses on the ascending process of the maxilla, the jugal. and the rostrolateral wing of the parietal, and the presence of a ridge on the lateral surface of the maxilla) and distinguished from all other prosauropods by a unique combination of cranial character states. Previous suggestions that Lufengosaurus is congeneric with either Massospondylus or Yunnanosaurus are rejected on the basis of craniodental evidence. Comparison with published character codings for Lufengosaurus reveals numerous discrepancies that are demonstrated to affect the phylogenetic position of the genus and patterns of sauropodomorph interrelationships.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The Lower Lufeng Formation (Lower Jurassic: ?Hettangian–?Sinemurian) of Yunnan Province, China, has yielded an important and diverse fauna of terrestrial vertebrates that is dominated by early sauropodomorph dinosaurs (prosauropods and basal sauropods). Nevertheless, few of these animals have been studied in detail, undermining their potential significance in understanding sauropodomorph phylogeny, palaeobiology, and palaeoecology. Here, we present a detailed re-description of the cranial osteology of Yunnanosaurus huangiYoung, 1942 and propose an emended diagnosis for this taxon on the basis of numerous autapomorphic characters (including an expanded internarial bar, unusual midline cranial bosses, and the possession of elongate maxillary tooth crowns lacking marginal serrations). Incorporation of these novel anatomical data into existing phylogenetic analyses of sauropodomorph interrelationships substantially affects the resolution, length, and topologies of the trees recovered. Although the phylogenetic position of Yunnanosaurus remains labile, these new analyses undermine previous suggestions that the former was the sister taxon of the southern African prosauropod Massospondylus. Several features of the skull of Yunnanosaurus (small external nares, cranial bosses, tooth crown morphology, and the lack of maxillary foramina) indicate that the palaeobiology of Yunnanosaurus may have been rather different from that of other prosauropods and basal sauropods, although more detailed functional studies and better material are needed to confirm this suggestion. {\copyright} 2007 Natural History Museum, London.

  Abstract                 = {{Most living vertebrates, from teleosts to tetrapods, are osteichthyans (bony fishes)1, but the origin of this major group is poorly understood2. The actinopterygians (ray-finned bony fishes) are the most successful living vertebrates in terms of diversity. They appear in the fossil record in the Late Silurian but are poorly known before the Late Devonian. Here we report the discovery of the oldest and most primitive actinopterygian-like osteichthyan braincase known, from 400–million-year-old limestone in southeastern Australia. This specimen displays previously unknown primitive conditions, in particular, an opening for a cartilaginous eyestalk. It provides an important and unique counterpart to the similarly aged and recently described Psarolepis from China and Vietnam3, 4. The contrasting features of these specimens, and the unusual anatomy of the new specimen in particular, provide new insights into anatomical conditions close to the evolutionary radiation of all modern osteichthyan groups.}},

In addition to its greater absolute size, S. angustirostris is differentiated from Saurolophus osborni by an upturned premaxillary body, a more strongly reflected oral margin of the premaxilla, the absence of an anterior notch in the prenarial fossa, a sigmoidal contour of the ventral half of the anterior process of the jugal, a shallow quadratojugal notch on the quadrate, and by a strongly bowed quadrate in lateral view. Phylogenetic analysis corroborates a sister taxon relationship between S. angustirostris and S. osborni. Saurolophus itself is characterised by a solid, rod-like crest composed of the nasals, frontals, and prefrontals; secondary elongation of the frontal and prefrontal resulting in the backwards extension of the frontal platform; a frontal platform that extends dorsal to the anterior portion of the supratemporal fenestra; a parietal that is excluded by the squamosals from the posterodorsal margin of the occiput; and the presence of two supraorbital elements. Although the palaeobiogeographic history of Saurolophus remains unresolved, at least two possible dispersal events took place across Beringia during the late Campanian leading to the evolution of the clade composed of Kerberosaurus, Prosaurolophus, and Saurolophus.}},

Details of the braincase, palate, and nasal crest that were either missed or disputed by previous authors are clarified. The nasal crest is buttressed caudally and caudolaterally by elongations of the frontals and prefrontals, respectively. The unique morphology of the frontals and prefrontals permit differentiation of S. osborni from other hadrosaurs. S. osborni can be differentiated from Saurolophus angustirostris by a relatively shorter frontal contribution to the nasal crest, a relatively straight premaxilla in lateral view, a weakly upturned oral margin of the premaxilla, and the absence of a vertical sulcus on the prootic above cranial nerve V. A reassessment of the phylogenetic affinities of S. osborni, exclusive of S. angustirostris, suggests it is most closely related to the Laurasian taxa Prosaurolophus and Kerberosaurus.}},

The skull lacks the braincase (including the frontals) and much of the nasals, and the preserved portions are crushed or plastically deformed, which makes anatomical interpretations difficult. A preserved midline fragment of the conjoined nasals suggests that it lacked a gryposaur-like ?Roman nose?, but the nature of the crest, if present, is impossible to determine with certainty. A phylogenetic analysis places this specimen as either the sister taxon of Saurolophus or as the sister taxon to a clade comprising Edmontosaurus and Anatotitan. There is no compelling morphological evidence to support the previous assignment of LACM/CIT 2852 to Saurolophus rather than to Edmontosaurus, and its poor preservation prevents positive assignment to any taxon below Hadrosaurinae indet. Given its geographic setting and morphological uncertainties, it is also possible that this specimen represents a separate taxon, but more material is needed to clarify the identity of the Moreno hadrosaurine. LACM/CIT 2852 does, however, provide evidence that Maastrichtian hadrosaurines ranged west of the Sierra Nevada magmatic arc, in an area where dinosaur diversity is poorly known.}},

A cladistic analysis of the Archosauromorpha using characters presented by previous workers results in a single most parsimonious tree with the Pterosauria as the major sister-group of the Dinosauria. However, that sister-group relationship is supported only by a suite of hindlimb characters that are correlated with bipedal digitigrade locomotion in dinosaurs. In pterosaurs the characters have been interpreted as correlates of bipedal cursorial locomotion, arboreal leaping, or involvement of the hindlimb in the wing. The homology of those characters in dinosaurs and pterosaurs cannot be supported. Reanalysis of the data after exclusion of those hindlimb characters results in most parsimonious trees with the Pterosauria as the sister-group of the Erythrosuchidae + Proterochampsidae +Euparkeria + Archosauria, in that order. This sister-group relationship is supported by a diverse assemblage of functionally independent skeletal characters from all regions of the skeleton. The results of the analysis cast doubt on the hypothesis that pterosaurs evolved flight from the ground up.}},

Unlike whales or dolphins (Cetacea), the earliest evolutionary history of sirenians is poorly documented, and limited to a few fossils including skulls and skeletons of two genera composing the stem family of Prorastomidae (Prorastomus and Pezosiren). Surprisingly, these fossils come from the Eocene of Jamaica, while stem Hyracoidea and Proboscidea - the putative sister-groups to Sirenia - are recorded in Africa as early as the Late Paleocene. So far, the historical biogeography of early Sirenia has remained obscure given this paradox between phylogeny and fossil record. Here we use X-ray microtomography to investigate a newly discovered sirenian petrosal from the Eocene of Tunisia. This fossil represents the oldest occurrence of sirenians in Africa. The morphology of this petrosal is more primitive than the Jamaican prorastomids' one, which emphasizes the basal position of this new African taxon within the Sirenia clade. This discovery testifies to the great antiquity of Sirenia in Africa, and therefore supports their African origin. While isotopic analyses previously suggested sirenians had adapted directly to the marine environment, new paleoenvironmental evidence suggests that basal-most sea cows were likely restricted to fresh waters.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Non-avian theropod dinosaurs attained large body sizes, monopolising terrestrial apex predator niches in the Jurassic\^{a}Cretaceous. From the Middle Jurassic onwards, Allosauroidea and Megalosauroidea comprised almost all large-bodied predators for 85 million years. Despite their enormous success, however, they are usually considered absent from terminal Cretaceous ecosystems, replaced by tyrannosaurids and abelisaurids. We demonstrate that the problematic allosauroids Aerosteon, Australovenator, Fukuiraptor and Neovenator form a previously unrecognised but ecologically diverse and globally distributed clade (Neovenatoridae, new clade) with the hitherto enigmatic theropods Chilantaisaurus, Megaraptor and the Maastrichtian Orkoraptor. This refutes the notion that allosauroid extinction pre-dated the end of the Mesozoic. Neovenatoridae includes a derived group (Megaraptora, new clade) that developed long, raptorial forelimbs, cursorial hind limbs, appendicular pneumaticity and small size, features acquired convergently in bird-line theropods. Neovenatorids thus occupied a 14-fold adult size range from 175\^{A} kg (Fukuiraptor) to approximately 2,500\^{A} kg (Chilantaisaurus). Recognition of this major allosauroid radiation has implications for Gondwanan paleobiogeography: The distribution of early Cretaceous allosauroids does not strongly support the vicariant hypothesis of southern dinosaur evolution or any particular continental breakup sequence or dispersal scenario. Instead, clades were nearly cosmopolitan in their early history, and later distributions are explained by sampling failure or local extinction.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Basal synapsids (?pelycosaurs?) form the basalmost portion of the mammalian stem lineage and document the transition from primitive ?reptile-like? basal amniotes to derived, mammal-like therapsids. They dominated terrestrial ecosystems of the latest Carboniferous and Early Permian (?300?271 million years ago), producing large-bodied terrestrial animals (3?6.5 metres long), high-fibre herbivores, and macropredators for the first time in vertebrate history, alongside an array of smaller-bodied forms. Despite numerous recent discoveries and reassessments of fossils collected over the past 250 years, and despite their importance for understanding the early diversification of terrestrial vertebrates, a comprehensive assessment of global relationships among basal synapsids has not been undertaken. A new phylogenetic dataset comprising 45 taxa (plus four outgroups and four therapsids) and 239 characters (147 cranial; 92 postcranial) reveals considerable uncertainty in the relationships of higher clades of basal synapsids. Although cranial data support the current consensus that Caseasauria is the most basal clade, postcranial data and the full dataset suggest that a clade of Ophiacodontidae + Varanopidae occupies this position. Although relationships within higher clades are well supported, relationships among those clades are poorly supported. The likely source of this uncertainty lies in the exceptionally poor early record of the group, which renders determinations of the plesiomorphic condition of higher clades speculative, although cranial data are generally represented by shorter ghost lineages and should perhaps be favoured. The new dataset suggests well-supported phylogenetic placements for several taxa of historically uncertain affinities: Trichasaurus is a caseid; Lupeosaurus is an edaphosaurid; and Basicranodon and Ruthiromia are varanopids.}},

  Abstract                 = {Megalosaurus bucklandii (Dinosauria: Theropoda), the oldest named dinosaur taxon, from the Bathonian (Middle Jurassic) of England, is a valid taxon diagnosed by a unique character combination of the lectotype dentary. Abundant referred material is described and several autapomorphies are identified: ventral surfaces of first and third to fifth sacral centra evenly rounded, ventral surface of second sacral centrum bearing longitudinal, angular ridge; dorsally directed flange around midheight on the scapular blade; an array of posterodorsally inclined grooves on the lateral surface of the median iliac ridge; anteroposteriorly thick ischial apron with an almost flat medial surface; and complementary groove and ridge structures on the articular surfaces between metatarsals II and III. A new phylogenetic analysis focuses on basal tetanurans and includes 41 taxa, six of which have never been included in a cladistic analysis, and 213 characters, 29 of which are new. This is the first phylogenetic analysis to focus on basal tetanuran relationships, and it reveals several new results. Megalosauroidea (= Spinosauroidea) includes two clades, basal to the traditional content of Megalosauridae + Spinosauridae. These comprise Xuanhanosaurus, Marshosaurus, Condorraptor + Piatnitzkysaurus and Chuandongocoelurus + Monolophosaurus. Almost all large-bodied Middle Jurassic theropods are megalosauroids, but Poekilopleuron is an allosauroid. Megalosauroids show geographical differentiation among clades, indicating the development of endemic theropod faunas across Pangaea during the Middle Jurassic. Notably, megalosaurids are not known from outside of Europe during this epoch. Megalosauroids are less diverse and abundant during the Late Jurassic, when most theropods are neotetanurans and allosauroids dominate the large-bodied predator niche. This indicates faunal turnover between the Middle and Late Jurassic. {\\\\\\\\copyright} 2009 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2010, 158, 882–935.},

One of only two definitive Jurassic tyrannosauroids known from more than isolated elements, it is the largest Jurassic tyrannosauroid reported to date and provides additional evidence for the presence of relatively small-or medium-sized basal tyrannosauroids in Asia, North America, and Europe during the Late Jurassic. The occurrence of Stokesosaurus in the Tithonian of the UK and USA and the absence of tyrannosauroids in contemporaneous west African faunas supports the hypothesis of a paleobiogeographic link during the Late Jurassic between North America and Europe, to the exclusion of Africa.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Marine and terrestrial animals show a mosaic of lineage extinctions and diversifications during the Jurassic–Cretaceous transition. However, despite its potential importance in shaping animal evolution, few palaeontological studies have focussed on this interval and the possible climate and biotic drivers of its faunal turnover. In consequence evolutionary patterns in most groups are poorly understood. We use a new, large morphological dataset to examine patterns of lineage diversity and disparity (variety of form) in the marine tetrapod clade Plesiosauria, and compare these patterns with those of other organisms. Although seven plesiosaurian lineages have been hypothesised as crossing the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary, our most parsimonious topology suggests the number was only three. The robust recovery of a novel group including most Cretaceous plesiosauroids (Xenopsaria, new clade) is instrumental in this result. Substantial plesiosaurian turnover occurred during the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary interval, including the loss of substantial pliosaurid, and cryptoclidid diversity and disparity, followed by the radiation of Xenopsaria during the Early Cretaceous. Possible physical drivers of this turnover include climatic fluctuations that influenced oceanic productivity and diversity: Late Jurassic climates were characterised by widespread global monsoonal conditions and increased nutrient flux into the opening Atlantic-Tethys, resulting in eutrophication and a highly productive, but taxonomically depauperate, plankton. Latest Jurassic and Early Cretaceous climates were more arid, resulting in oligotrophic ocean conditions and high taxonomic diversity of radiolarians, calcareous nannoplankton and possibly ammonoids. However, the observation of discordant extinction patterns in other marine tetrapod groups such as ichthyosaurs and marine crocodylomorphs suggests that clade-specific factors may have been more important than overarching extrinsic drivers of faunal turnover during the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary interval.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Invasion of the open ocean by tetrapods represents a major evolutionary transition that occurred independently in cetaceans, mosasauroids, chelonioids (sea turtles), ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs. Plesiosaurian reptiles invaded pelagic ocean environments immediately following the Late Triassic extinctions. This diversification is recorded by three intensively-sampled European fossil faunas, spanning 20 million years (Ma). These provide an unparalleled opportunity to document changes in key macroevolutionary parameters associated with secondary adaptation to pelagic life in tetrapods. A comprehensive assessment focuses on the oldest fauna, from the Blue Lias Formation of Street, and nearby localities, in Somerset, UK (Earliest Jurassic: 200 Ma), identifying three new species representing two small-bodied rhomaleosaurids (Stratesaurus taylori gen et sp. nov.; Avalonnectes arturi gen. et sp. nov) and the most basal plesiosauroid, Eoplesiosaurus antiquior gen. et sp. nov. The initial radiation of plesiosaurs was characterised by high, but short-lived, diversity of an archaic clade, Rhomaleosauridae. Representatives of this initial radiation were replaced by derived, neoplesiosaurian plesiosaurs at small-medium body sizes during a more gradual accumulation of morphological disparity. This gradualistic modality suggests that adaptive radiations within tetrapod subclades are not always characterised by the initially high levels of disparity observed in the Paleozoic origins of major metazoan body plans, or in the origin of tetrapods. High rhomaleosaurid diversity immediately following the Triassic-Jurassic boundary supports the gradual model of Late Triassic extinctions, mostly predating the boundary itself. Increase in both maximum and minimum body length early in plesiosaurian history suggests a driven evolutionary trend. However, Maximum-likelihood models suggest only passive expansion into higher body size categories.}},

A well-preserved giant pliosaurid skull from the Late Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay Formation of Dorset, United Kingdom, represents a new species, Pliosaurus kevani. This specimen is described in detail, and the taxonomy and systematics of Late Jurassic pliosaurids is revised. We name two additional new species, Pliosaurus carpenteri and Pliosaurus westburyensis, based on previously described relatively complete, well-preserved remains. Most or all Late Jurassic pliosaurids represent a globally distributed monophyletic group (the genus Pliosaurus, excluding 'Pliosaurus' andrewsi). Despite its high species diversity, and geographically widespread, temporally extensive occurrence, Pliosaurus shows relatively less morphological and ecological variation than is seen in earlier, multi-genus pliosaurid assemblages such as that of the Middle Jurassic Oxford Clay Formation. It also shows less ecological variation than the pliosaurid-like Cretaceous clade Polycotylidae. Species of Pliosaurus had robust skulls, large body sizes (with skull lengths of 1.7–2.1 metres), and trihedral or subtrihedral teeth suggesting macropredaceous habits. Our data support a trend of decreasing length of the mandibular symphysis through Late Jurassic time, as previously suggested. This may be correlated with increasing adaptation to feeding on large prey. Maximum body size of pliosaurids increased from their first appearance in the Early Jurassic until the Early Cretaceous (skull lengths up to 2360 mm). However, some reduction occurred before their final extinction in the early Late Cretaceous (skull lengths up to 1750 mm).}},

Leptocleidids have often been interpreted as basal members of Pliosauroidea, and their presence in marginal marine and even freshwater facies has led to suggestions that they might represent late-surviving relicts, perhaps related to the Lower Jurassic rhomaleosaurids. We describe a new leptocleidid, Vectocleidus pastorum gen. et sp. nov., from the late Barremian part of the Cowleaze Chine Member (Vectis Formation), Isle of Wight, UK, and undertake a detailed reassessment of leptocleidid anatomy and relationships. New data on the long-necked Brancasaurus gives extra support to a monophyletic Leptocleididae with taxa of ?intermediate' body plan and robust skulls, Leptocleidus superstes, Leptocleidus capensis, Nichollssaura and Vectocleidus. Thus, leptocleidids adopted a range of body plans on the pliosauromorph?plesiosauromorph spectrum. Support for a placement of Leptocleididae within Pliosauroidea is weak, and most proposed synapomorphies fail the test of similarity. However, numerous synapomorphies, including many new observations, support a derived position within Plesiosauroidea. Thus, the ?intermediate' body plan of many leptocleidids is not plesiomorphic, and plesiosaurian body plan evolution was complex and highly plastic. We also summarize the anatomy of ?Cimoliasaurus' valdensis, a short-necked Early Cretaceous taxon. ?C.' valdensis is a valid taxon for which we erect the new monotypic genus Hastanectes. Hastanectes shows evidence of possible pliosaurid affinities. Thus, multiple plesiosaurian clades may have invaded margin and freshwater environments. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:8A0A8BD0-F6BB-4F74-BB18-79CBBA2F105C}},

This represents a new species of Hauffiosaurus, H. tomistomimus, distinguished from H. zanoni (Harpoceras serpentinum Zone, Lower Toarcian, Germany) by the proportionally shorter neck and strongly concave preaxial margin of the tibia. It differs from H. longirostris (previously 'Macroplata'longirostris; Har. serpentinum Zone, Yorkshire) by the absence of prominent midline ridges on the dorsal surface of the premaxillae and ventral surface of the mandibular symphysis, and the absence of midline pterygoid contact ventral to the basioccipital. Several synapomorphies support a monophyletic Hauffiosaurus: broad longitudinal troughs occupy the dorsolateral surface of the maxilla and the posterior half of the lateral surface of the dentary; basicranial fontanelle bounded laterally by posterolaterally elongate projections of an undetermined ossification; and the neural arch contacts the rib facet in all postaxial cervical vertebrae.

There is little evidence for geographic differentiation of Lower Toarcian plesiosaurian faunas in the United Kingdom and Germany as minor differences between abundant taxa may arise from temporal offset of fossils from these regions, and marked taxonomic differences are confined to rare taxa whose absence in one or other area may be attributable to incomplete sampling. Lack of consensus on the relationships of Lower Jurassic plesiosaurians requires further detailed description of Lower Jurassic taxa.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The phylogenetic position of Scleromochlus taylori has been disputed recently, in terms of whether it is a basal sister group of Pterosauria or of Dinosauromorpha. The seven specimens, all from the Lossiemouth Sandstone Formation (late Carnian, Late Triassic) of Lossiemouth, near Elgin, north–east Scotland, suggest that Scleromochlus shares no unique features with either Pterosauria or Dinosauromorpha, together the Ornithodira, but is a close outgroup. Scleromochlus retains a primitive ankle structure, and it has a slender humerus, femur and fibula. Scleromochlus shows the classic bird–like characters of a tibia that is longer than the femur, and a closely appressed group of four elongate metatarsals. A new group name, Avemetatarsalia ('bird feet'), is established here for the clade consisting of Scleromochlus and Ornithodira, and their descendants. A reanalysis of crown–group archosaur relationships confirms the split into Crurotarsi (crocodile relatives) and Ornithodira (bird relatives), as well as the clear division of Ornithodira into Pterosauria and Dinosauromorpha. Relationships within Crurotarsi are, however, much less clear: Ornithosuchidae probably reside within that clade, and there might be a clade 'Rauisuchia' consisting of Prestosuchidae and Postosuchus, but support for these relationships is weak. Scleromochlus was probably a bipedal cursor that could adopt a digitigrade stance. However, it is possible that Scleromochlus was also a saltator, capable of leaping long distances.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The rhynchosaur Rhynchosaurus articeps Owen, 1842, from the Middle Triassic of Grinshill, northern Shropshire, England, was a small reptile, about 0.5 m long. About 17 individual animals are represented by skulls, complete skeletons and partial skeletons, and these have permitted detailed restorations. The skull (60-80 mm long) is low and broad at the back, and it shows all of the typical rhynchosaur features of beak-like premaxillae, single median naris, fused parietal, broad maxillary tooth plate and dentary, both with multiple rows of teeth, and a deep lower jaw. The skeleton shows adaptations for fast terrestrial locomotion with a semi-erect hindlimb posture and for scratch-digging with the hind-foot. The skeleton is relatively more slender than that of most other middle and late Triassic rhynchosaurs, but this is probably an allometric effect of its much smaller size (they are typically 1-2 m long). A further species of Rhynchosaurus from Warwick, named here R. brodiei, is represented by 15 specimens of partial skulls, tooth-bearing elements, and isolated postcranial bones. It was slightly larger than R. articeps, with a typical skull length of 90 mm, and estimated body length of 0.6 m, but the skull length ranged up to 140 mm. It differs from R. articeps in having a much larger jugal in the cheek area, and in the greater height and breadth of the skull. The isolated maxillary fragments from Bromsgrove probably also belong to R. brodiei. The third species of Rhynchosaurus from Devon, named here R. spenceri, is now known from numerous specimens of at least 25 individuals, most of which were collected recently. These show a range in estimated skull length from 40 to 170 mm, but most specimens are at the upper end of that range, with an average skull length of 140 mm, and an estimated total body length of 0.9-1.0 m R. spenceri differs from R. articeps and R. brodiei in having a skull that is broader than it is long (otherwise a character of late Triassic rhynchosaurs), and it shares the large jugal character with R. brodiei. Teeth are not well preserved in R. articeps, but several specimens of R. brodiei and R. spenceri give detailed information. The pattern of wear, and the nature of the jaw joint, suggest that Rhynchosaurus had a precision-shear bite, as in other rhynchosaurs, with no back and forwards motion. The maxilla had two grooves, a major and a minor one, which received two matching ridges of the dentary on occlusion. The multiple rows of teeth on maxilla and dentary, and the surrounding bone, wore down as uniform units. The diet was probably tough vegetation, which was dug up by scratch-digging, raked together with the hands or the premaxillary beak, and manipulated in the mouth by a strong tongue. Rhynchosaurus is found variously in fluvial-intertidal deposits with evidence of desiccation (Grinshill, Warwick, Bromsgrove), and fluvial-aeolian deposits laid down in arid conditions with occasional flash floods (Devon). The bones have generally been transported (Warwick, Bromsgrove, Devon), but the Grinshill specimens are largely complete and undisturbed. The associated floras and faunas at Warwick, Bromsgrove, and Devon include pteridophytes, gymnospermopsids, bivalves, scorpions, freshwater fish, temnospondyl amphibians and reptiles (macrocnemids, thecodontians,?procolophonids). Rhynchosaurs are archosauromorph diapsids, possibly related to the enigmatic Trilophosaurus, and a sister group to Prolacertiformes+Archosauria. A cladistic analysis of Rhynchosauria reveals one major subgroup, the Hyperodapedontinae (Hyperodapedon and Scaphonyx), which is late Triassic in age. The earlier rhynchosaurs, including the middle Triassic Stenaulorhynchus and Rhynchosaurus, appear to form successively closer outgroups to the Hyperodapedontinae. The three species of Rhynchosaurus share only one possible synapomorphy in comparison with Stenaulorhynchus: The dentary is well over half the length of the lower jaw. The `Rhynchosaurinae' (Stenaulorhynchus and Rhynchosaurus) was not established as a monophyletic group in the present analysis. These two genera share two postulated synapomorphies: the occipital condyle lies well in front of the quadrates, and there are two grooves on the maxilla and two ridges on the dentary. A third postulated synapomorphy, the presence of a single row of teeth on the pterygoid, has not been confirmed in this study for either Rhynchosaurus or Stenaulorhynchus. However, these postulated synapomorphies are outweighed by the synapomorphies that Rhynchosaurus shares with the Hyperodapedontinae. The specimens of Rhynchosaurus have been used as biostratigraphic indicators for the English middle Triassic, indicating Anisian to early Ladinian ages. The three species can be arranged in a sequence from `most primitive' to `most advanced', but this cannot be used confidently to give a stratigraphic sequence.}},

Although much of the original topotype material found in the 1830s in Bristol, England, has now been lost, some 245 specimens remain. These indicate a small, gracile prosauropod, up to 2.5 m in length, distinguished primarily on the absence of derived characters seen in other prosauropods. Although attempts were formerly made to subdivide the Bristol specimens into several dinosaurian, and other, taxa, most appear to pertain to the prosauropod Thecodontosaurus antiquus. The specimens do indicate a clear separation into two morphs, a gracile and a robust form, presumably evidence of sexual dimorphism. A juvenile Thecodontosaurus sp. from South Wales may belong to the same species. A cladistic analysis indicates that Prosauropoda is probably a clade, rather than a series of outgroups to Sauropoda, but support for this conclusion is weak. Echoing other recent cladistic analyses, stronger support is found for the existence of a clade Sauropodomorpha, made up from Prosauropoda + Sauropoda, for the clade Sauropoda itself, and for the clade Eusauropoda within Sauropoda.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACTSaltopus elginensis, reported in 1910 from the yellow sandstones of the Lossiemouth Sandstone Formation (Late Triassic) of Morayshire, NE Scotland, has long been controversial. It was described first as a theropod dinosaur, but others disagreed. Reanalysis of the type, and only, specimen using casts from the natural rock moulds, as well as X-rays and CT scans, has revealed new anatomical data not available to previous researchers. Saltopus was a small, 800–1000 mm-long biped, whose tail made up more than half its length. It is an avemetatarsalian because it has elongated and tightly bunched metatarsals, the tibia is longer than the femur, the calcaneal tuber is rudimentary or absent, and metatarsal II is equal to or longer than metatarsal IV; a unique assemblage of characters diagnosing this clade. Saltopus is a dinosauromorph on the basis of the reduced fingers IV and V, the saddle-shaped dorsal margin of the iliac blade, and the articulation of sacral rib 1 close to the front of the iliac blade. Saltopus is a dinosauriform on the basis of the trochanteric shelf and lesser trochanter on the proximal end of the femur, the waisted sacral ribs, and perhaps the rod-like and straight pubis. However, it lacks all apomorphies of Dinosauria, retaining for example the primitive condition of two sacral vertebrae. Cladistic analyses place Saltopus within Dinosauromorpha and Dinosauriformes, and between the basal dinosauriform Pseudolagosuchus and the derived clade consisting of Silesauridae and Dinosauria, so making it one of a radiation of small pre-dinosaurian bipedal archosaurs in the Triassic found so far in North and South America and in Europe.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Erpetosuchus, a small archosaurian reptile from the Late Triassic of Scotland and North America, hasoften been implicated in the ancestry of crocodilians. A restudy of the type specimen, using new high-fidelity casts, as well as examinationof new, hitherto undescribed material, allows a detailed description and restoration of Erpetosuchus granti from the LossiemouthSandstone Formation (late Carnian, Late Triassic). This small reptile is known only from the front end of its body; a complete skull,cervical vertebral column, anterior dorsals and ribs, shoulder girdle, and forelimb. The skull shows a number of unusual features: a reducedrow of only 4–5 teeth on the anterior part of the maxilla, a large antorbital fenestra set in a deep fossa whose margins aremarked by distinct sharply angled ridges, a jugal that is divided into a lateral and a ventral portion by a sharp ridge, a deeplyrecessed tympanic area, the angular and surangular marked by a strong ridge running back from the ventral margin of the mandibular fenestra,and teeth oval in cross-section and lacking anterior and posterior carinae and marginal serrations. The remains suggest that Erpetosuchus wasa light, cursorial animal that may have fed on insects. A cladistic analysis of crurotarsan archosaurs indicates that Erpetosuchus isthe closest sister group of Crocodylomorpha among known basal archosaurs. It shares with them a deep recess in the cheek region framed bythe quadrate and quadratojugal which slope forward side-by-side at an angle of 45° above horizontal, and reach the uppermargin of the lower temporal fenestra. In Erpetosuchus the recess is entirely lateral, while in crocodylomorphs, the recesspenetrates medially as well, since the quadrate/quadratojugal bar meets the side wall of the braincase. {\copyright} 2002The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2002, 136, 25–47.}},

Here, we present a previously unrecognized unique morphological character offering support for this hypothesis: the presence in stem turtles of a laterosphenoid ossification identical to that in Archosauriformes. The laterosphenoid is a tripartite chondrocranial ossification, consisting of an ossified pila antotica, pila metoptica, and taenia medialis + planum supraseptale. It forms the anterior border of the exit for the trigeminal nerve (V) and partially encloses the exits for cranial nerves III, IV, and II. This ossification is unique to turtles and Archosauriformes within Vertebrata. It has been mistakenly dismissed as anatomically dissimilar in these two groups in the past, so we provide a complete description and detailed analysis of correspondence between turtles and Archosauriformes in each of its embryologically distinct components. A preliminary phylogenetic analysis suggests other potential synapomorphies of turtles and archosaurs, including a row or rows of mid-dorsal dermal ossifications.}},

As indicated by our phylogenetic analysis, the fossil belongs to a taxon most likely close to the ancestral root of the Notoungulata. We describe the entire external anatomy of this isolated ear bone and also investigate the bony labyrinth of the inner ear through computed tomographic scan reconstruction. Within Notoungulata, the specimen retains a number of features considered plesiomorphic, such as a narrow medial flange on the tympanic surface, the presence of a petromastoid canal, and a rather deep fossa subarcuata. We also present a survey of the petrosal anatomy of early diverging notoungulates compared with other members of Eutheria. Features regarded as plesiomorphic in Notoungulata comprise a low stapedial ratio, a cavity for the trigeminal ganglion, a secondary crus commune, a ramus superior of stapedial artery (although reduced) and arteria diplo\"{e}tica magna, and the tegmen tympani pierced by a canal. Derived features include notably a laterally located tensor tympani fossa, a bean-shaped promontorium and adjoining flattened medial flange, and a stapedial fossa poorly separated from the postpromontorial tympanic sinus. A number of derived notoungulate characters are interestingly shared with the extant hyrax Procavia. Further investigation of this anatomical region in other eutherians is required in order to fully exploit the phylogenetic potential of our new observations. This is especially needed for other groups of South American endemic ungulates possibly related to Notoungulata.

A revised diagnosis is proposed and the published synapomorphies for Dinosauria and less inclusive clades (e.g. Saurischia) are evaluated for this species. Some characters previously identified as present in the holotype, including the intramandibular joint, hyposphene-hypantrum articulations in dorsal vertebrae, and a cranial trochanter and trochanteric shelf on the femur, cannot be confirmed due to poor preservation or are absent in the available material. In addition, postcranial characters support a close relationship between S. pricei and Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis Reig, 1963 (Late Triassic, Argentina), forming the clade Herrerasauridae. Several pelvic and vertebral characters support the placement of S. pricei as a saurischian dinosaur. Within Saurischia, characters observed in the holotype, including the anatomy of the dentition and caudal vertebrae, support theropod affinities. However, the absence of some characters observed in the clades Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha suggests that S. pricei is not a member of Eusaurischia. Most morphological characters discussed in previous phylogenetic studies cannot be assessed for S. pricei because of the incompleteness of the holotype and only known specimen. The phylogenetic position of S. pricei is constrained by that of its sister taxon H. ischigualastensis, which is known from much more complete material.}},

The outcome of this analysis, including 37 morphological characters coded for 15 extant and fossil taxa, as well as non-coded features of mandibular morphology, was used to reconstruct broad outlines of hippo phylogeny. Distinct lineages within the paraphyletic genus Hexaprotodon are recognized and characterized. In order to harmonize taxonomy and phylogeny, two new genera are created. The genus name Choeropsis is re-validated for the extant Liberian hippo. The nomen Hexaprotodon is restricted to the fossil lineage mostly known in Asia, but also including at least one African species. The genus Hippopotamus is confirmed. These changes represent substantial advances for understanding the evolutionary history of the Hippopotamidae, and provide a new framework for future studies. {\copyright} 2005 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2005, 143, 1–26.}},

A phylogenetic analysis, based on 21 cranial characters, indicates that, among hadrosaurines, Kerberosaurus is the sister taxon of a monophyletic group formed by Prosaurolophus and Saurolophus. Several independent hadrosaurid lineages migrated from western North America to eastern Asia, probably by late Campanian to early Maastrichtian time.

Remains include an incomplete maxilla with ten teeth, six cervical and dorsal vertebrae, and several associated girdle and limb bones. Ligabuesaurus is characterized by: (1) laminar and anteroposteriorly compressed neural spines on posterior cervical and anterior dorsal vertebrae that are rhomboid in shape and wider than vertebral centra; (2) spinoprezygapophyseal laminae in the posterior cervical vertebrae forked to form two pairs: the medial laminae contact one another toward the tip of the neural spine, and the lateral pair form the lateral border of the neural spine; (3) dorsoventrally reduced neural arch pedicels in posterior cervical and anterior dorsal vertebrae; and (4) rudimentary prespinal lamina on posterior cervical and anterior dorsal vertebrae. A preliminary phylogenetic analysis suggests that Ligabuesaurus is a basal titanosaur. The development of relatively long forelimbs, with a humerus/femur ratio of 0.9, indicates that this condition is not an exclusive adaptation of the Brachiosauridae.}},

Cladistic analysis suggests a relationship between Czatkowiella and the Late Permian long−necked reptile Protorosaurus, but fails to support a monophyletic Prolacerti− formes. Czatkowiella and Protorosaurus do not group with either Prolacerta or the Tany− stropheus/ Macrocnemus clade of other workers, and fall at the very base of Archosauro− morpha. Thus the long−necked morphology of many archosauromorph taxa should be re− garded as a primitive state within this group, reversed in some daughter lineages such as rhynchosaurs and trilophosaurs.}},

These skeletons allow the recognition of new features for H. scholtzi, including a strong anterior inclination of the occiput, exclusion of the quadratojugal from the temporal fenestra, a maxilla-prefrontal contact, and a maxilla-quadratojugal contact. In addition to some of these features, the absence of an anterodorsal contact between the squamosal and the jugal allows us to assign H. scholtzi to the varanopid clade Mycterosaurinae. Phylogenetic analysis of Varanopidae using an augmented data matrix from the literature positions Heleosaurus as the sister taxon of Elliotsmithia within the varanopid subfamily Mycterosaurinae. Both this sister-group relationship and the monophyly of Mycterosaurinae are weak and collapse with one extra step. Many of the clades discovered in the analysis exhibit the same support level, however, indicating that further studies on varanopids are needed.}},

Some authors noted that they resemble both pelicans and allies (Pelecaniformes) and tube-nosed birds (Procellariiformes), but assigned them to a distinct taxon, the Odontopterygiformes. In most recent studies, the pseudo-toothed birds are referred to the family Pelagornithidae inside the Pelecaniformes. Here, I perform a cladistic analysis with five taxa of the pseudo-toothed birds including two undescribed new species from the Early Tertiary of Morocco. The present hypothesis strongly supports a sister group relationship of pseudo-toothed birds (Odontopterygiformes) and waterfowls (Anseriformes). The Odontoanserae (Odontopterygiformes plus Anseriformes) are the sister group of Neoaves. The placement of the landfowls (Galliformes) as the sister taxon of all other neognathous birds does not support the consensus view that the Galloanserae (Galliformes plus Anseriformes) are monophyletic.}},

Lithoptila abdounensis gen. et sp. nov. is represented by a single, well-preserved neurocranium, dated as upper Paleocene (Thanetian) on the basis of the selachians identified in the matrix. This specimen is the oldest known African neornithine bird and the oldest record of the Prophaethontidae. It bears some striking resemblance to Prophaethon shrubsolei Andrews, 1899, from the lower Eocene (Ypresian) London Clay of the Isle of Sheppey, England. Aside from general proportions of the neurocranium, this new taxon differs from Prophaethon shrubsolei in many respects, such as the shape and position of the crista temporalis, impressio glandulae nasalis, surface of contact with the os lacrimale, and tuberculum basilare. This justifies its assignment to a new genus and species. A cladistic analysis of 47 osteological characters supports the monophyly of the Prophaethontidae and a sister-group relationship between the Prophaethontidae and Phaethontidae. The Pelecaniformes are polyphyletic, and the clade comprising the Phaethontidae and Prophaethontidae is the sister-group of the Procellariiformes.}},

Discovery of previously unrecognized cranial material from the paratype specimen of Thescelosaurus neglectus (USNM 7758), along with the examination of two new specimens that preserve nearly complete skulls and mandibles, allows for reevaluation of specimens previously referred to Thescelosaurus that preserve cranial material, including the holotypes of Bugenasaura infernalis (SDSM 7210) and Parksosaurus warreni (ROM 804). A phylogenetic analysis was conducted that included as terminals the holotypes of B. infernalis and P. warreni, the type series of T. neglectus, and six specimens previously referred to Thescelosaurus. This analysis is the first to recover a clade containing all basal neornithischian taxa from the Cretaceous of North America, within which P. warreni is recovered as the sister taxon to a Thescelosaurus clade whose monophyly is supported by five cranial autapomorphies. The results of this analysis support: (1) the synonymization of Bugenasaura with Thescelosaurus; (2) the removal of ROM 804 from Thescelosaurus; and (3) the validity of Thescelosaurus garbanii and its referral to Thescelosaurus despite its fragmentary nature. Currently, Parksosaurus and Thescelosaurus are the only basal neor-nithischian taxa definitively known from Maastrichtian age sediments of North America, while other basal neornithischian taxa proposed to demonstrate fossorial behavior (i.e., Orodromeus, Oryctodromeus, and Zephyrosaurus) are known from Campanian and older sediments. This temporal segregation may support previous hypotheses of an environmental or ecological shift during the latest Cretaceous in North America.}},

  Abstract                 = {{10.1093/sysbio/syp019 Distinguishing phylogenetic signal from homoplasy (shared similarities among taxa that do not arise by common ancestry) is an implicit goal of any phylogenetic study. Large amounts of homoplasy can interfere with accurate tree inference, and it is expected that common measures of clade support, including bootstrap proportions and Bayesian posterior probabilities, should also be impacted to some degree by homoplasy. Through data simulation and analysis of 38 empirical data sets, we show that high amounts of homoplasy will affect all measures of clade support in a manner that is dependent on clade size. More specifically, the smallest taxon bipartitions in an unrooted tree topology will receive higher support relative to clades of intermediate sizes, even when all clades are supported by the same amount of data. We determine that the ultimate causes of this effect are the inclusion of random trees (due to homoplasy) during bootstrap resampling and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) topology searching and the higher relative proportion of small taxon bipartitions (i.e., 2 or 3 taxa) to larger sized bipartitions. However, the use of explicit model-based methods, especially Bayesian MCMC methods, effectively overcomes this clade size effect even when very small amounts of phylogenetic signal are present. We develop a post hoc statistic, the clade disparity index (CDI), to measure both the relative magnitude of the clade size effect and its statistical significance. In analyses of both simulated and empirical data, CDI values indicate that Bayesian MCMC analyses are substantially more likely to estimate clade support values that are uncorrelated with clade size than are maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood bootstrap analyses and thus less affected by homoplasy. These results may be especially relevant to \^{a}deep\^{a} phylogenetic problems, such as reconstructing the tree of life, as they represent the largest possible extremes of time and evolutionary rates, 2 factors that cause homoplasy.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Modern gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates) emerged in the early Palaeozoic era1, but this event remains unclear owing to a scant early fossil record. The exclusively Palaeozoic 'acanthodians' are possibly the earliest2, 3 gnathostome group and exhibit a mosaic of shark- and bony fish-like characters that has long given them prominence in discussions of early gnathostome evolution1. Their relationships with modern gnathostomes have remained mysterious, partly because their un-mineralized endoskeletons rarely fossilized. Here I present the first-known braincase of an Early Devonian (approximately 418–412 Myr bp) acanthodian, Ptomacanthus anglicus 4, and re-evaluate the interrelationships of basal gnathostomes. Acanthodian braincases have previously been represented by a single genus, Acanthodes 5, which occurs more than 100 million years later in the fossil record. The braincase of Ptomacanthus differs radically from the osteichthyan-like braincase of Acanthodes 5 in exhibiting several plesiomorphic features shared with placoderms6, 7 and some early chondrichthyans8, 9. Most striking is its extremely short sphenoid region and its jaw suspension, which displays features intermediate between some Palaeozoic chondrichthyans and osteichthyans. Phylogenetic analysis resolves Ptomacanthus as either the most basal chondrichthyan or as the sister group of all living gnathostomes. These new data alter earlier conceptions of basal gnathostome phylogeny and thus help to provide a more detailed picture of the acquisition of early gnathostome characters.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Letognathus gen. nov. is described from the Lower Carboniferous (Tournaisian) Horton Bluff Formation. Included in this genus is the species Letognathus hardingi (Dawson 1868), which was originally assigned toRhizodus and later toStrepsodus, but it is distinct from these genera in tooth morphology and the presence of several more primitive rhizodontid characters. By contrast with these latter more derived genera, the parasymphysial plate contacts the first coronoid; the first coronoid bears a row of lingually deflected teeth, the tooth striations occur around the entire circumference of the crown and are much finer and less regular than those ofStrepsodus, and marginal tooth row reaches anteriorly to the dentary symphysis. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that rhizodontid jaws primitively bear symphysial tusks; slender recumbent teeth; an anterior projection of the dentary over the anteromesial depression for the median symphysial plate and shows the highly derived jaws ofStrepsodus andRhizodus evolved within the Rhizodontida, rather than as primitive characters for the group. This new jaw material supports earlier models of mandibular kinesis and shows that the coronoid fangs were oriented such as to facilitate kinesis. Rhizodontid jaw evolution seems to be marked by parallelisms with tristichopterids and early tetrapods.}},

It has abrupt supratemporal fenestral rims, extensive supraoccipital exposure on the skull table, and bipartite ventral osteoderms. The nasals are reduced to a thin anterior process as they approach the external naris, and the rim of the naris extends beyond the dorsal surface of the snout as a thin crest. There was no ?spectacle? between the orbits, but there are three distinct craniocaudally elongate ridges between the orbits. The parietal extends to the posterior margin of the skull table on either side of the large V-shaped dorsal exposure of the supraoccipital. Some of the dorsal osteoderms are mediolaterally elongate and bear two dorsal keels. A close relationship with caimans is supported by a parsimony analysis, although its precise position is unclear and some of the characters supporting a caimanine relationship also occur in poorly known Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary alligatoroids. A possible close relationship with Paleosuchus (the living dwarf caimans) would imply a very complex biogeographic scenario with multiple dispersals between the Americas during the Tertiary.}},

The type series cannot be identified, but the original description includes details consistent with known specimens that almost certainly pertain to the same species. It had a prominent triangular 'horn' on the posterolateral corner of each squamosal; near-exclusion of the nasals from the external naris; constricted supratemporal fenestral rims; a dorsoventrally deep snout; a constricted external mandibular fenestra in which the surangular2013angular suture emerges from the posterior rather than posteroventral margin; and robust limb and limb girdle elements. It shares with Osteolaemus, and with several extinct crocodylids from the Neogene of Africa, a depressed surface of the pterygoid around the internal choana forming a choanal 'neck'. It cannot be referred to Crocodylus and a new praenomen, Voay, is established for its reception. Voay persisted into the Holocene and may have been extant when humans first settled Madagascar 2000 years ago, when it may have been a casualty of a megafaunal extinction event on the island. This is consistent with molecular data that suggest comparatively recent dispersal of Crocodylus niloticus to Madagascar from mainland Africa.  {\\\\\\\\copyright} 2007 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2007, 150, 8352013863.},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract A new crocodylid is described on the basis of fragmentary, but diagnostic, material from the Quaternary of Aldabra Atoll. It differs from all other known crocodylians, living or extinct, in having a prominent semicircular crest, or ?horn,? on the dorsolateral margin of the squamosal. Unlike the horns seen in some living Crocodylus, the apex of each horn was at its midpoint anterior to the external otic aperture and not near its posterior end. It also has a highly vaulted premaxillary palate and an anterodorsally-oriented external naris, and dorsal exposure of the supraoccipital on the skull table was extensive. Phylogenetic relationships of the new form are unclear, making its biogeographic origins difficult to trace, but it was very likely an immigrant from elsewhere and not endemic to Aldabra Atoll, as it occurs in deposits formed shortly after a period of submergence ended 120,000 years ago.}},

It is a slender-snouted form and can be distinguished from most other crocodylians on the basis of an enlarged quadrate foramen aereum; a distinct W-shaped rugosity along the ventral margin of the basioccipital tuber; a prominent crest on the lateral braincase wall encompassing portions of the quadrate, pterygoid, and basisphenoid, forming the lateral wall of the lateral eustachian canal at its ventralmost extent; and arrangement of dentary alveoli into couplets. Specimens of larger crocodylians from the same units may represent either the adult form of E. minor or a separate taxon. The enlarged quadrate foramen aereum, couplet arrangement of dentary alveoli, and basioccipital tuber shape are shared with Eosuchus lerichei from the Late Paleocene of Europe. Eosuchus lies within Gavialoidea crownward of the basal forms Thoracosaurus and Eothoracosaurus. The braincase of Eosuchus is intermediate between that of Thoracosaurus and that of Gavialis; the basisphenoid retains a short (but externally visible) descending lamina, but the basisphenoid is also anteroposteriorly expanded at the level of the median eustachian foramen.}},

A revised phylogenetic analysis supports a set of relationships in which the type species of Allognathosuchus (A. polyodon) is closer to Alligator than it is to European ?Allognathosuchus? or ?Allognathosuchus? from the North American Paleocene, and a close relationship between Allognathosuchus and Wannaganosuchus is not supported. One European fossil assigned to Allognathosuchus, A. woutersi, is similar (and possibly referable) to Diplocynodon. Chrysochampsa mlynarskii can be distinguished from all other Early Tertiary alligatoroids, but its relationships to other members of the clade (and whether it should be placed within Allognathosuchus) are unclear. These results support multiple dispersal events of alligatorines from North America to Eurasia, and suggest that the cranial anatomy thought to distinguish forms such as Allognathosuchus is plesiomorphic at the level of Alligatoridae. The name Allognathosuchus should be applied in a restricted sense to Allognathosuchus polyodon and its closest relatives, with alternative generic names applied to distantly related ?Allognathosuchus.?}},

Less complete material from the late Campanian or early Maastrichtian of western Tennessee is referred to this taxon. It can be distinguished from late Maastrichtian Thoracosaurus neocesariensis on the basis of a wider distance between the supratemporal fenestrae, a long anterior frontal process, and closer apposition of the third and fourth dentary alveoli. Longirostrine crocodylian remains from the later Maastrichtian and earliest Paleocene of New Jersey pertain to a single species (Thoracosaurus neocesariensis), as do remains from the early Paleocene of France and Sweden (Thoracosaurus macrorhynchus). The basisphenoid in these animals is still an anteroposteriorly thin lamina wedged between the basioccipital and pterygoid, reflecting the ?verticalized? condition seen in extant non-gavialoid crocodylians. At least some late Paleocene occurrences from New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia can be referred to Thecachampsoides minor (Marsh, 1870), and a second larger gavialoid may also be present in these units. North American ?thoracosaurs? lacked antorbital fenestrae. ?Thoracosaurinae? are a para-phyletic grade at the base of Gavialoidea, with Thecachampsoides being closer to Gavialis than are Thoracosaurus or Eothoracosaurus. Prior referral of ?thoracosaurs? to Tomistominae reflects a typological approach to taxonomy, with longirostrine crocodylians maintaining plesiomorphic rostral states being regarded as tomistomines.}},

Parsimony analysis of 164 discrete morphological characters supports several previous hypotheses based on morphology and molecules: Diplocynodon, from the European Tertiary, is a monophyletic alligatoroid lineage; Brachychampsa and Stangerochampsa are derived alligatoroid taxa but not demonstrably within the crown-group Alligatoridae; and, within the crown-group, caimans form a robust clade. However, this study indicates the paraphyly of ?Allognathosuchus;? the alligatoroid affinities of Leidyosuchus canadensL but not of most other ?Leidyosuchus;? the very distant relationship between Hylaeochampsa and any extant crocodylian lineage, including Alligatoroidea; and the fact that Diplocynodon must extend at least as far as the Campanian, even though the oldest well-known Diplocynodon are from the Eocene. This work supports a close relationship between Diplocynodon and Baryphracta deponiae from the Eocene of Germany; monophyly of Alligator and the caiman assemblage as currently applied in the literature; the caiman affinities of the bizarre nettosuchids and Purussaurus; and a closer relationship between Caiman latirostris and Melanosuchus niger than between C. latirostris and other Caiman. Phylogenetic taxonomic principles have been applied to Crocodylia by several workers, and this study expands upon this with a discussion of phylogeny-based name definitions for Crocodylia and nested subgroups. Leidyosuchus is the basalmost alligatoroid, but within its sister taxon we can recognize a pair of stem-based groups?Diplocynodontinae (Diplocynodon rateili and all taxa closer to it than to Alligator mississippiensis) and Globidonta (Alligator mississippiensis and all taxa closer to it than to Diplocynodon rateili). The crown-group Alligatoridae (last common ancestor of Alligator, Caiman, Melanosuchus, and Paleosuchus and all of its descendents) can likewise be split into a pair of stem-based daughter lineages: Alligatorinae (Alligator and taxa closer to it than to Caiman) and Caimaninae (Caiman and taxa closer to it than to Alligator). Salt intolerance has been used by previous authors to force alligatorid dispersal along land bridges. Despite the problem of inappropriate climate, a land crossing across Beringia during the Late Tertiary best explains the current existence of an Asiatic alligatorid (Alligator sinensis), but based on known fossil occurrences, caimans and alligators diverged from each other in North America sometime during the Late Cretaceous and spread to South America by the Paleocene, when North and South America were separated. A single dispersal event at or near the Cretaceous-Tertiary Boundary is sufficient to explain the presence of caimans in South America, with a reinvasion from South America explaining the presence of a nettosuchid in the North American Eocene (Orthogenysuchus).}},

The name Listrognathosuchus is established for L. multidentatus, which is an alligtoroid, but difficult to characterize further because of its incompleteness. The remaining taxa form a clade herein named Borealosuchus; this group is related to, but not within, a monophyletic group that includes Alligatoroidea and Crocodyloidea.

  Abstract                 = {{Although morphological data have historically favored a basal position for the Indian gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) within Crocodylia and a Mesozoic divergence between Gavialis and all other crocodylians, several recent molecular data sets have argued for a sister-group relationship between Gavialis and the Indonesian false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) and a divergence between them no earlier than the Late Tertiary. Fossils were added to a matrix of 164 discrete morphological characters and subjected to parsimony analysis. When morphology was analyzed alone, Gavialis was the sister taxon of all other extant crocodylians whether or not fossil ingroup taxa were included, and a sister-group relationship between Gavialis and Tomistoma was significantly less parsimonious. In combination with published sequence and restriction site fragment data, Gavialis was the sister taxon of all other living crocodylians, but the position of Tomistoma depended on the inclusion of fossil ingroup taxa; with or without fossils, preferred morphological and molecular topologies were not significantly different. Fossils closer to Gavialis than to Tomistoma can be recognized in the Late Cretaceous, and fossil relatives of Tomistoma are known from the basal Eocene, strongly indicating a divergence long before the Late Tertiary. Comparison of minimum divergence time from the fossil record with different measures of molecular distance indicates evolutionary rate heterogeneity within Crocodylia. Fossils strongly contradict a post-Oligocene divergence between Gavialis and any other living crocodylian, but the phylogenetic placement of Gavialis is best viewed as unresolved. 10.1093/sysbio/46.3.479}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract A well-preserved crocodyliform specimen from the Maastrichtian or Paleocene of Mali preserves the braincase and posterior dermatocranium. It is referred to Dyrosauridae on the basis of several derived features (a prominent anterior process of the postorbital, discrete occipital processes on the exoccipitals, significant quadratojugal contribution to jaw joint) and tentatively referred to Rhabdognathus on the basis of supratemporal fenestra shape. The lacrymal and prefrontal are relatively short compared with those published for other dyrosaurids. The palatines border the internal choanae anteriorly, and the choanae are divided by a midline septum derived from the pterygoids. The prefrontal pillars are mediolaterally broad and contact the palate ventrally. One stapes is preserved in place. The basicranial pneumatic system is very unusual, in that the anterior and posterior branches of the median eustachian canal are both separate at the palatal surface, and the pterygoids form part of the border for the anterior branch. The lateral eustachian openings lie within fossae on the lateral surface of the braincase and face laterally, with a descending process of the exoccipital nearly intersecting the opening. The braincase and surrounding dermal bones are elongate anteroposteriorly, and the postorbital's posterior ramus extends along the posterodorsal margin of the infratemporal fenestra. The quadrate ramus projects ventrally. These observations clarify character optimizations in previous phylogenetic analyses of Crocodyliformes.}},

Crocodylus cataphractus is the basalmost living species, and monophyletic New World and Indopacific assemblages are supported. The Indian Mugger (Crocodylus palustris) is closely related to the Indopacific assemblage. Most fossils assigned to Crocodylus do not belong to the crown genus. Only one extinct fossil included in the analysis, Crocodylus palaeindicus (= C. sivalensis), falls within the crown-group Crocodylus and is of uncertain affinities within the group; Adams consensus trees draw C. palaeindicus toward the root of non?cataphractus Crocodylus, and the Nile crocodile (C. niloticus) is the sister taxon to the New World assemblage. The oldest fossil diagnostically belonging to the clade is from the Late Miocene, which is congruent with previous protein distance estimates of a Late Tertiary divergence among living species. Fossils and molecules never actually clashed regarding divergence timing, because very different meanings were applied to the name Crocodylus by paleontologists and neontologists.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT We describe a new crocodile, Crocodylus thorbjarnarsoni, sp. nov., on the basis of skulls and jaws from Pliocene and Pleistocene deposits in the Lake Turkana Basin of Kenya. The new species has a comparatively broad, deep snout and resembles an extinct horned crocodile from the Quaternary of Olduvai Gorge (C. anthropophagus), but the squamosal ?horns? are not as well developed. The skull table has a strongly trapezoidal outline different from those of the living Nile crocodile (C. niloticus) and crocodiles from late Miocene deposits in the Turkana Basin. The largest specimens are from animals up to 7.5 m in total length. It would have been the largest predator in its environment, and the early humans found in the same deposits were presumably part of its prey base. A phylogenetic analysis, including the new species and an improved sample of extinct crocodyline diversity, suggests a more complex phylogenetic and biogeographic history for the clade in Africa and the eastern Indian Ocean region than previously supposed. The analysis limits the known geographic and stratigraphic range of Rimasuchus lloydi, previously thought to occur throughout Africa from the early Miocene through the Pleistocene of northern Africa. Crocodylus niloticus is not known with certainty from units older than the Quaternary, and most late Miocene fossils from the Turkana Basin previously referred to C. niloticus can instead be referred to C. checchiai. The current first appearance datum for Crocodylus in Africa is approximately 7 Ma.}},

Some symplesiomorphies are ” homologies” inasmuch as they represent synapomorphies of more inclusive taxa; others are complementary character states that do not imply any shared evolutionary history among the taxa that exhibit the state. Undirected character-state change (as characters optimized on an unrooted tree) is a necessary but not sufficient test of homology, because the addition of a root may alter parsimonious reconstructions. Primary and secondary homology are defended as realistic representations of discovery procedures in comparative biology, recognizable even in Direct Optimization. The epistemological relationship between homology as evidence and common ancestry as explanation is again emphasized. An alternative definition of homology is proposed.}},

The differences are taxonomically informative and we recognize this specimen as the holotype of a new species, Thescelosaurus assiniboiensis sp. nov., diagnosed by the presence of two autapomorphies, and displaying plesiomorphic traits more similar to those of Parksosaurus, than to those of the other Thescelosaurus species. The Frenchman Formation also harbours an intriguing faunal assemblage in which Thescelosaurus represents one of the most abundant dinosaur taxa, and preserves a relatively high proportion of small (putatively juvenile and subadult) specimens of many dinosaur taxa. Further work that increases the faunal sample from this formation, and that permits quantitative comparisons with contemporary formations, will determine whether or not these differences are well supported, and will determine their ultimate palaeobiological significance. Identification of a third species of Thescelosaurus from the late Maastrichtian of North America suggests that this taxon was more diverse than previously recognized, and shows an increase in diversity from the Campanian through the late Maastrichtian, contrasting the trends seen in most other ornithischian clades. {\copyright} 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 163, 1157–1198.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Relative to large-bodied dinosaurs, the diversity of small-bodied dinosaurs from the Campanian of North America is poorly understood due to a lack of well-preserved skeletons. We document the first articulated remains, as well as the first cranial bones, of non-iguanodontian ornithopods from the Belly River Group of Alberta. The geologically oldest specimen consists of the posterior half of an articulated skeleton from the middle unit of the Oldman Formation and shares many anatomical features with the contemporaneous Orodromeus makelai and the older Oryctodromeus cubicularis. A second, younger specimen from the upper Oldman Formation is distinct from other ornithopods in having a reduced distal portion of the fibula that is fused to the anterior surface of the tibia; it is designated as the type of a new taxon, Albertadromeus syntarsus, gen. et sp. nov. Numerous isolated elements from small ornithopods from the Dinosaur Park Formation are also identified, but cannot be assigned to the generic level with confidence. Although small-bodied ornithopod material is rare, their known postcranial material outnumbers those of taphonomically equivalent and contemporaneous pachycephalosaurs, which are known to be abundant and diverse due to their robust and frequently recovered cranial domes. These findings suggest considerable undiscovered diversity of small-bodied ornithopods, and highlight biases against the preservation of small taxa in this system.

  Abstract                 = {{Little is known about the evolution of large-bodied theropod dinosaurs during the Early to mid Cretaceous in Asia. Prior to this time, Asia was home to an endemic fauna of basal tetanurans, whereas terminal Cretaceous ecosystems were dominated by tyrannosaurids, but the intervening 60 million years left a sparse fossil record. Here, we redescribe the enigmatic large-bodied Chilantaisaurus maortuensis from the Turonian of Inner Mongolia, China. We refer this species to a new genus, Shaochilong, and analyze its systematic affinities. Although Shaochilong has previously been allied with several disparate theropod groups (Megalosauridae, Allosauridae, Tyrannosauroidea, Maniraptora), we find strong support for a derived carcharodontosaurid placement. As such, Shaochilong is the first unequivocal Asian member of Carcharodontosauridae, which was once thought to be restricted to Gondwana. The discovery of an Asian carcharodontosaurid indicates that this clade was cosmopolitan in the Early to mid Cretaceous and that Asian large-bodied theropod faunas were no longer endemic at this time. It may also suggest that the ascent of tyrannosaurids into the large-bodied dinosaurian predator niche was a late event that occurred towards the end of the Cretaceous, between the Turonian and the Campanian.}},

The fragmentary nature of these Jurassic specimens, however, has frustrated attempts to understand their systematics and phylogeny. A new specimen from the Late Jurassic of England was recently named as a new species (Stokesosaurus langhami) of the genus Stokesosaurus, which is known from several fragmentary fossils from North America. We review the systematics and phylogeny of these European and North American specimens and show that there are no unequivocal synapomorphies uniting them. Furthermore, a revised phylogenetic analysis does not recover them as sister taxa. This necessitates a taxonomic revision of this material, and we name a new genus (Juratyrant) for the British specimen.}},

We redescribe K. petrolicus and note that it possesses a single autapomorphy (a deep accessory groove on the lateral surface of the anterior dentary), as well as a unique combination of characters that differentiates it from other theropods, affirming its validity. A phylogenetic analysis recovers K. petrolicus as a basal carcharodontosaurid, which is supported by various features: very deep interdental plates (a carcharodontosaurid synapomorphy), fused interdental plates (present in carchardontosaurids and a limited number of other theropods), and the absence of diagnostic features of other clades of large-bodied theropods such as abelisaurids, megalosauroids, and coelurosaurs.

However, the higher-level phylogenetic relationships within Archosauria are poorly resolved and controversial, despite years of study. The phylogeny of crocodile-line archosaurs (Crurotarsi) is particularly contentious, and has been plagued by problematic taxon and character sampling. Recent discoveries and renewed focus on archosaur anatomy enable the compilation of a new dataset, which assimilates and standardizes character data pertinent to higher-level archosaur phylogeny, and is scored across the largest group of taxa yet analysed. This dataset includes 47 new characters (25\% of total) and eight taxa that have yet to be included in an analysis, and total taxonomic sampling is more than twice that of any previous study. This analysis produces a well-resolved phylogeny, which recovers mostly traditional relationships within Avemetatarsalia, places Phytosauria as a basal crurotarsan clade, finds a close relationship between Aetosauria and Crocodylomorpha, and recovers a monophyletic Rauisuchia comprised of two major subclades. Support values are low, suggesting rampant homoplasy and missing data within Archosauria, but the phylogeny is highly congruent with stratigraphy. Comparison with alternative analyses identifies numerous scoring differences, but indicates that character sampling is the main source of incongruence. The phylogeny implies major missing lineages in the Early Triassic and may support a Carnian-Norian extinction event.}},

However, despite the publication of 12 cladistic analyses little phylogenetic consensus has emerged, frustrating attempts to use these dinosaurs to study character evolution, biogeography and the quality of the fossil record. Here we analyse a core subset of allosauroids using cladistic methodology and several comparative methods. After reviewing previous studies and their points of disagreement, we present a new cladistic analysis that integrates data from these studies with new characters. This analysis finds strong support for placing Sinraptor as a basal allosauroid, Neovenator as a basal member of Carcharodontosauridae and Acrocanthosaurus as a more derived member of Carcharodontosauridae, rather than the sister taxon of Allosaurus as sometimes advocated. The current dataset is compared in detail to those of previous studies to determine the degree of overlap and the basis for differing topologies. These comparisons show that scoring differences, character choice and taxonomic sampling all play a major role in generating incongruence. Finally, the recovered most parsimonious topology is used to assess character evolution, stratigraphical congruence and biogeography. This topology shows a strong overall match with the stratigraphical record and is much more congruent with stratigraphy than any alternative topology. The biogeographical history of core allosauroids is found to be congruent with the breakup sequence of Pangaea, but more complete assessment is hampered by sampling biases.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT The Ha?eg Island fauna of the terminal Late Cretaceous (ca. 71?65 million years ago) of Romania is one of the most unusual dinosaur assemblages in the global fossil record. It has long been recognized that many herbivorous dinosaurs from the Ha?eg fauna were dwarfed, morphologically aberrant, and/or primitive relative to mainland contemporaries, and these taxa are often considered examples of the so-called island effect: the evolutionary phenomenon by which island-dwelling species are often dwarfed and anatomically modified. Very little, however, is known about the carnivorous dinosaurs that inhabited Ha?eg Island, and it is unclear whether they were also dwarfed, aberrant, or primitive. In 2009, the discovery of the first substantially complete theropod from the Late Cretaceous of Europe, the holotype of the Romanian dromaeosaurid Balaur bondoc, provided the first clear glimpse at an island-dwelling carnivorous dinosaur. Here we describe and figure this remarkably preserved skeleton in detail. We provide detailed descriptions and photographs of individual bones, and make extensive comparisons with other dromaeosaurids (and other derived coelurosaurian theropods). This monographic description provides further evidence that Balaur is an unusual derived dromaeosaurid, closely related to Velociraptor, with a remarkably modified hand and foot skeleton, including a stocky and heavily fused distal hind limb, a double set of hyperextensible pedal claws, and a fused and atrophied hand, which are otherwise unknown among derived coelurosaurian theropods. We present an updated diagnosis of Balaur based on additional preparation of the holotype, comparisons with other dromaeosaurids, and careful consideration of postmortem crushing. Histological techniques demonstrate that both the holotype and a referred specimen of Balaur, which is approximately 50\% larger than the holotype and from a separate locality, belong to mature individuals. Therefore, we remove the referred specimen from Balaur bondoc and conservatively consider it Balaur sp. We present an updated assessment of the phylogenetic relationships of Balaur based on a comprehensive new coelurosaurian cladistic dataset, which corroborates the close relationship between Balaur, Velociraptor, Deinonychus, Adasaurus, and Saurornitholestes. We review the fossil record of European Late Cretaceous theropods and show that other specimens from the Late Cretaceous of Romania (including the holotype of Elopteryx), France, and Hungary either do not belong to Balaur (due to the lack of Balaur autapomorphies) or cannot be compared to Balaur because of a lack of overlapping material. Finally, we discuss the biogeographic history of European terminal Cretaceous dinosaur faunas and comment on the extreme morphological specializations of Balaur. We conclude that the phylogenetic position of Balaur, a derived dromaeosaurid closely related to Late Cretaceous Laurasian taxa, is inconsistent with previous hypotheses of long-term geographic endemicity of the Romanian island faunas, but argue that the aberrant Bauplan of Balaur is similar to that seen in some living and recently extinct mammals and thus likely due to the ?island effect.?}},

These include an elongate snout with an array of conical teeth, a dorsoventrally flattened skull and a posteriorly positioned jaw articulation, which provides a powerful bite force. Here we report an exquisitely preserved specimen of a new taxon from the Late Cretaceous of Madagascar that deviates profoundly from this Bauplan, possessing an extremely blunt snout, a tall, rounded skull, an anteriorly shifted jaw joint and clove-shaped, multicusped teeth reminiscent of those of some ornithischian dinosaurs. This last feature implies that the diet of the new taxon may have been predominantly if not exclusively herbivorous. A close relationship with notosuchid crocodyliforms, particularly Uruguaysuchus (Late Cretaceous, Uruguay)2 is suggested by several shared derived features; this supports a biogeographical hypothesis that Madagascar and South America were linked during the Late Cretaceous3 . }},

They are not taphonomically deformed by expanding matrix distortion, unlike many Gobi specimens, including the holotype of P. grangeri. Bayan Mandahu is also the type locality for Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus. The proximity in space and time of these two closely related species warrants a generic and specific revision for Pinacosaurus. The distinction of the two species is based on characters of the squamosal dermal elaborations, cranial roof posterior to the orbits, premaxillary notch, and distal margin of the ilium. Although a relatively well-represented ankylosaur taxon, the phylogenetic position of Pinacosaurus has not been unequivocally resolved.

The description of the holotype, which comes from the Upper Cretaceous deposits of Valioara in the Hateg Basin of Romania (Late Maastrichtian), is included with those of other undescribed specimens from the uppermost Cretaceous of Spain and southern France. All the specimens preserve the same anatomical region as the holotype and provide new relevant information on the genus Allodaposuchus and its phylogenetic position. The phylogenetic context of A. precedens is discussed in the context of a recent cladistic analysis of Eusuchia and its crown-group Crocodylia. Allodaposuchus is unambiguously the sister taxon of the crown-group Crocodylia, sharing with this clade the absence of a lingual to maxillary occlusion of the dentary teeth, and the extension of the ectopterygoid that does not reach the posterior tip of the lateral pterygoid flange, among other characters. The phylogenetic analysis also raises the problem of the ambiguous definition of Eusuchia, since the characters traditionally used in its diagnosis are multiply derived. Allodaposuchus is an outstanding crocodyliform providing new anatomical evidence concerning the stem-group of Crocodylia, and filling the gap between the Early Cretaceous (Barremian) Hylaeochampsa and the earliest common ancestor of Crocodylia.}},

'Fabrosaurus australis' is based upon a single undiagnostic dentary, and is here considered a nomen dubium. Lesothosaurus diagnosticus is considered to be valid and is rediagnosed based upon a unique combination of plesiomorphic and derived characteristics. Stormbergia dangershoeki gen. et. sp. nov. is described from three partial skeletons including numerous postcranial material. Stormbergia dangershoeki is significantly larger than previously described Elliot Formation ornithischians, and can be recognized on the basis of a unique combination of characters, the most important of which is the possession of a distinctive tab-shaped obturator process on the ischium. A preliminary systematic analysis is presented, the results of which differ significantly from other recent ornithischian phylogenies. {\copyright} 2005 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2005, 145, 175–218.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Archosaurs (birds, crocodilians and their extinct relatives including dinosaurs) dominated Mesozoic continental ecosystems from the Late Triassic onwards, and still form a major component of modern ecosystems (>10,000 species). The earliest diverse archosaur faunal assemblages are known from the Middle Triassic (c. 244 Ma), implying that the archosaur radiation began in the Early Triassic (252.3–247.2 Ma). Understanding of this radiation is currently limited by the poor early fossil record of the group in terms of skeletal remains. We redescribe the anatomy and stratigraphic position of the type specimen of Ctenosauriscus koeneni (Huene), a sail-backed reptile from the Early Triassic (late Olenekian) Solling Formation of northern Germany that potentially represents the oldest known archosaur. We critically discuss previous biomechanical work on the 'sail' of Ctenosauriscus, which is formed by a series of elongated neural spines. In addition, we describe Ctenosauriscus-like postcranial material from the earliest Middle Triassic (early Anisian) R\"{o}t Formation of Waldhaus, southwestern Germany. Finally, we review the spatial and temporal distribution of the earliest archosaur fossils and their implications for understanding the dynamics of the archosaur radiation. Comprehensive numerical phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that both Ctenosauriscus and the Waldhaus taxon are members of a monophyletic grouping of poposauroid archosaurs, Ctenosauriscidae, characterised by greatly elongated neural spines in the posterior cervical to anterior caudal vertebrae. The earliest archosaurs, including Ctenosauriscus, appear in the body fossil record just prior to the Olenekian/Anisian boundary (c. 248 Ma), less than 5 million years after the Permian–Triassic mass extinction. These earliest archosaur assemblages are dominated by ctenosauriscids, which were broadly distributed across northern Pangea and which appear to have been the first global radiation of archosaurs.}},

The largest specimens of Fruitadens represent young adults in their fifth year of development and are estimated at just 65–75 cm in total body length and 0.5–0.75 kg body mass. They are thus the smallest known ornithischians. Fruitadens is a late-surviving member of the basal dinosaur clade Heterodontosauridae, and is the first member of this clade to be described from North America. The craniodental anatomy and diminutive body size of Fruitadens suggest that this taxon was an ecological generalist with an omnivorous diet, thus providing new insights into morphological and palaeoecological diversity within Dinosauria. Late-surviving (Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous) heterodontosaurids are smaller and less ecologically specialized than Early (Late Triassic and Early Jurassic) heterodontosaurids, and this ecological generalization may account in part for the remarkable 100-million-year-long longevity of the clade.}},

An understanding of the phylogeny, early evolution and diagnosis of the clade is hampered by a shortage of detailed anatomical descriptions of basal taxa. One of the most important basal ornithopod taxa discovered in recent years is Changchunsaurus parvus, from the Quantou Formation ('middle' Cretaceous) of Jilin Province, China, represented by excellent cranial and postcranial material. Here, we present the first description of the postcranial anatomy of the holotype specimen of Changchunsaurus and provide comparisons to other basal cerapodans and basal ornithopods. A phylogenetic analysis finds relationships amongst basal ornithopods to be extremely poorly resolved, but supports a sister-group relationship between Changchunsaurus and Jeholosaurus shangyuanensis from the Yixian Formation (late Barremian–early Aptian) of Liaoning Province, China. Numerous characters distinguish the two taxa, supporting their generic distinction. The proposed sister-group relationship suggests that an endemic clade of small-bodied bipedal ornithopods existed in north-east China during the Early to 'middle' Cretaceous.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Although the group played an important role in the evolution of Late Mesozoic terrestrial ecosystems, the early evolutionary history of the ornithischian dinosaurs remains poorly understood. Here, we report on a new primitive ornithischian, Eocursor parvus gen. et sp. nov., from the Late Triassic (?Norian) Lower Elliot Formation of South Africa. Eocursor is known from a single specimen comprising substantial cranial and postcranial material and represents the most complete Triassic member of Ornithischia, providing the earliest evidence for the acquisition of many key ornithischian postcranial characters, including an opisthopubic pelvis. A new phylogenetic analysis positions this taxon near the base of Ornithischia, as the sister taxon to the important and diverse clade Genasauria. The problematic clade Heterodontosauridae is also positioned basal to Genasauria, suggesting that an enlarged grasping manus may represent a plesiomorphic ornithischian condition. This analysis provides additional phylogenetic support for limited ornithischian diversity during the Late Triassic, and suggests that several major ornithischian clades may have originated later than generally believed. There are few morphological differences between Late Triassic and Early Jurassic ornithischians, supporting previous suggestions that the Early Jurassic ornithischian radiation may simply represent the filling of vacant ecological space following Late Triassic terrestrial extinctions.}},

  Abstract                 = {{SYNOPSISOrnithischia is a familiar and diverse clade of dinosaurs whose global phylogeny has remained largely unaltered since early cladistic analyses in the mid 1980s. Current understanding of ornithischian evolution is hampered by a paucity of explicitly numerical phylogenetic analyses that consider the entire clade. As a result, it is difficult to assess the robustness of current phylogenetic hypotheses for Ornithischia and the effect that the addition of new taxa or characters is likely to have on the overall topology of the clade.The new phylogenetic analysis presented here incorporates a range of new basal taxa and characters in an attempt to rigorously test global ornithischian phylogeny. Parsimony analysis is carried out with 46 taxa and 221 characters. Although the strict component consensus tree shows poor resolution in a number of areas, application of reduced consensus methods provides a well-resolved picture of ornithischian interrelationships. Surprisingly, Heterodontosauridae is placed as the most basal group of all well-known ornithischians, phylogenetically distant from a stem-defined Ornithopoda, creating a topology that is more congruent with the known ornithischian stratigraphical record. There is no evidence for a monophyletic , and Lesothosaurus (the best-known ) occupies an unusual position as the most basal member of Thyreophora. Other relationships within Thyreophora remain largely stable. The primitive thyreophoran Scelidosaurus is the sister taxon of Eurypoda (stegosaurs and ankylosaurs), rather than a basal ankylosaur as implied by some previous studies.The taxonomic content of Ornithopoda differs significantly from previous analyses and basal relationships within the clade are weakly supported, requiring further investigation. is paraphyletic, with some taxa (Agilisaurus, Hexinlusaurus, Othnielia) placed outside of Ornithopoda as non-cerapodans. Ceratopsia and Pachycephalosauria are monophyletic and are united as Marginocephalia; however, the stability of these clades is reduced by a number of poorly preserved basal taxa.This analysis reaffirms much of the currently accepted ornithischian topology. Nevertheless, instability in the position and content of several clades (notably Heterodontosauridae and Ornithopoda) indicates that considerable future work on ornithischian phylogeny is required and causes problems for several current phylogenetic definitions.}},

Here, we report on a new Late Triassic dinosaur from the Santa Maria Formation of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. The specimen comprises the disarticulated partial skeleton of a single individual, including most of the skull bones. Based on four phylogenetic analyses, the new dinosaur fits consistently on the sauropodomorph stem, but lacks several typical features of sauropodomorphs, showing dinosaur plesiomorphies together with some neotheropod traits. This is not an exception among basal dinosaurs, the early radiation of which is characterized by a mosaic pattern of character acquisition, resulting in the uncertain phylogenetic placement of various early members of the group.}},

Whereas previously these ichthyosaurs were assigned to one species, Stenopterygius hauffianus, our study shows there are two, Stenopterygius triscissus and Hauffiopteryx typicus. S. triscissus is a small- to medium-sized ichthyosaur up to 3.5 m long, characterised by three apomorphies: long and slender rostrum, large elliptical supratemporal fenestra and bipartite pelvis. H. typicus is a small ichthyosaur up to 2.95 m long, with five apomorphies: short and extremely slender rostrum, very large orbit, small rounded supratemporal fenestra and tripartite pelvis, which is fused distally. Cladistic analysis is equivocal about their relationships, suggesting either that Hauffiopteryx and perhaps also Stenopterygius are members of a clade Eurhinosauria or that this clade does not exist, and both genera are members of a wider clade Thunnosauria. Further, the clade Stenopterygiidae, in which Hauffiopteryx had been located, is not identified. Most striking is that the specimens are all juveniles (five specimens) or infants (three specimens), ranging from one-tenth to one-half the normal adult length of the species.}},

These conocardioid rostroconchs were collected from Silurian deposits (late Llandovery to early Ludlow) near Avalanche Lake in the Mackenzie Mountains, Northwest Territories, Canada, and, when added to global rostroconch faunal lists, indicate a previously unrecognized diversity of Silurian conocardioid rostroconchs. The morphology of conocardioid rostroconchs is discussed, and a glossary of terms presented. Sexual dimorphism is recognized in species of Cassowarioides. Phylogenetic analysis of hippocardiids and bransoniids supports the monophyly of several genera. The hippocardiid genus Bigalea Pojeta and Runnegar, 1976, is recognized as paraphyletic and three species are assigned to a new genus, Redstonia. Preliminary analysis of bransoniids and hippocardiids for familial relationships, using data sets from the within-family analyses, indicates that the Bransoniidae is polyphyletic. The generic complex Mulceodens, considered to be derived bransoniid, is consistently reconstructed within a clade of derived hippocardiids.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Glishades ericksoni was named on the basis of partial paired premaxillae collected from the Late Campanian Two Medicine Formation of Montana, and was described as a non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroid. This interpretation of G. ericksoni has significant implications for hadrosauroid diversity and distribution because it represents the first occurrence of a non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroid in the Late Campanian of North America, and therefore implies either a prolonged period of sympatry between these forms and hadrosaurids or a biotic interchange with Asia. Given its small size, and therefore potential juvenile status, the taxonomic identity of G. ericksoni is re-evaluated here. Comparison with similarly-sized, taxonomically determinate, and coeval hadrosaurid specimens from the Two Medicine Formation (Prosaurolophus, Gryposaurus, and Maiasaura) suggest that the combination of characters used to distinguish G. ericksoni as a non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroid are more widely distributed or individually variable in hadrosaurids, or can be explained as the result of ontogenetic variation. In particular, the unique combination of characters used to diagnose G. ericksoni is also found in juvenile individuals of Prosaurolophus, Gryposaurus, and Maiasaura. Inclusion of juveniles of these taxa, scored on the basis of comparable anatomy, in the original phylogenetic analysis recovers the juvenile hadrosaurid specimens outside Hadrosauridae. Consequently, G. ericksoni cannot be confidently differentiated from a juvenile saurolophine, which are common in the upper and middle sections of the Two Medicine Formation, and is thus considered a nomen dubium. Given their absence in well-sampled Late Campanian and Maastrichtian deposits, non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroids appear to have been completely replaced by hadrosaurids in western North America by the Late Campanian.}},

The holotype was found in Late Cenomanian–Early Turonian outcrops of NW Patagonia, Argentina. This new taxon is deeply nested within a new clade of South American abelisaurids, named Brachyrostra. Within brachyrostrans, the skull shortening and hyperossification of the skull roof appear to be correlated with a progressive enclosure of the orbit, a set of features possibly related to shock-absorbing capabilities. Moreover, the development of horn-like structures and differential cranial thickening appear to be convergently acquired within Abelisauridae. Based on the similarities between Skorpiovenator and carcharodontosaurid tooth morphology, we suggest that isolated teeth originally referred as post-Cenomanian Carcharodontosauridae most probably belong to abelisaurids.}},

The holotype is a partially articulated skeleton of an adult individual recovered from the Arsis-1 site in Pe\~{n}arroya de Tastavins (Teruel) at the base of the marine Xert Formation. It is one of the most complete and best-preserved sauropod dinosaur skeletons from the European Early Cretaceous. The fossil remains comprise the three caudalmost thoracic vertebrae, part of a fourth, nine thoracic rib fragments, sacrum, 25 caudal vertebrae, 21 chevrons, both ilia, pubes, ischia and femora, right tibia, right fibula, six metatarsals, and seven pedal phalanges (including four unguals). The new taxon is defined by 19 autapomorphies. In our cladistic analysis, Tastavinsaurus is the sister-taxon of the North American Venenosaurus within Titanosauriformes, which includes the Brachiosauridae, Somphospondyli, and Titanosauria. The new taxon provides new information about the diversity of non-brachiosaurid titanosauriforms during the Early Cretaceous in Europe and paleobiogeographic relationships between Europe and North America.}},

The great development of the acromion process, directed in a markedly posterior direction, and the ventral margin of the scapula with a strong ventrodistal expansion, interpreted as autapomorphies of the taxon, justify the validity of the species. Although the material is rather fragmentary, the racquet-shaped scapula, the distal expansion positioned at the same height as the proximal expansion, and the well-developed acromion process allow the taxon to be included within Rebbachisauridae. At the same time, the angle of less than 90̊ between the coracoid articulation and the scapular blade, together with the great development of the acromion process of the scapula, justify its inclusion in a clade situated as a sister group of Cathartesaura. On the basis of the stratigraphic calibration of the phylogenetic analysis, an important diversification event of the rebbachisaurids is deduced during the Hauterivian-Barremian. In this context, the presence of two monophyletic groups, one of which comprises African-European taxa and the other South American taxa, would place the definitive separation of South America and Africa within this time interval.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Morphological changes in the ontogeny of sauropods are poorly known, making difficult to establish the systematic affinities of very young individuals. New information on an almost complete juvenile sauropod (SMA 0009) with an estimated total length of about 2 m is here presented. The specimen was described as a diplodocid owing to the presence of some putative synapomorphies of this group. However, recent further preparation revealed the absence of diplodocid characters and the presence of macronarian derived characters. To test the affinities of this specimen, a phylogenetic analysis was conducted. The strict consensus tree recovers the specimen as a basal titanosauriform, in an unresolved relation with Brachiosaurus and Giraffatitan. Nevertheless, a brachiosaurid assignment is here suggested in base of the widely accepted monophyly of this group (only recovered when SMA 0009 is placed within this group). Although the existence of a new taxon cannot be completely ruled out, the combination of derived and plesiomorphic characters in the specimen suggests its assignment to Brachiosaurus. Sixteen extra steps are needed to place this specimen within Diplodocidae. The high cost to place this specimen within this group is owing to the fact that several diplodocid characters are absent in SMA 0009, such as the absence of divided centroprezygapophyseal lamina in cervical vertebrae, procoelous anterior caudal centra, composed lateral lamina in anterior caudal vertebrae, elongated middle caudal vertebrae, short cervical ribs and caudolateral projection of distal condyle of metatarsal I. Finally, the systematic position reveals few major ontogenetic transformations. These affect the pneumatic structures (e.g. change from simple pleurocoels in the cervical vertebrae to complex pleurocoels and the development of lateral excavations in the dorsal vertebrae) but also include unrecorded transformations of the neural spine (e.g. the development of the spinodiapophyseal lamina, the widening of the neural spines in the dorsal vertebrae) and allometric growth in some limb bones.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Amygdalodon patagonicus is the oldest record of Sauropoda from South America and is known from several teeth and fragmentary postcranial remains. Here we describe in detail its dental morphology, characterized by the presence of broad spatulated teeth (with low SI values) and the absence of denticles in their crowns. The enamel bears a particular wrinkling pattern composed only of apicobasally-aligned pits, which are frequently joined to each other by a continuous sulcus. Some worn teeth have large wear-facets that extend over only one of the crown's edges. This unique combination of characters provides a proper diagnosis for Amygdalodon. Despite the fragmentary available material, Amygdalodon is here interpreted as a non-eusauropod sauropod based on the results of a phylogenetic analysis. The presence of derived dental characters in Amygdalodon, such as the presence of tooth-tooth occlusion, shows several features previously thought to diagnose Eusauropoda or Gravisauria appeared earlier during the early evolution of sauropods.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Titanosauriform sauropods were one of the most widely distributed groups of dinosaurs during the Cretaceous. In contrast to most derived forms from the Upper Cretaceous, the most basal taxa of the group are poorly known. Thus, studies on these forms are of special interest for understanding the origin and early evolution of Titanosauria. Chubutisaurus insignis del Corro, 1975, is known from postcranial remains found in the Bayo Overo Member of the Cerro Barcino Formation (Chubut Group), which is commonly regarded as Aptian?Cenomanian in age. Phylogenetic analyses that include Chubutisaurus recovered this taxon as the sister group to Titanosauria. Nevertheless, most published studies have not included this taxon, probably due to its brief description and fragmentary remains. Fieldwork conducted in the quarry where the holotype was found yielded new materials that are regarded as part of the same specimen. These new materials, together with additional undescribed, and briefly described elements, originally collected by G. del Corro, are described here. The new information allows the recognition of a more extensive diagnosis of this taxon. The phylogenetic analysis presented here resolves Chubutisaurus as the most basal somphospondylian.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The diversification and early evolution of neosauropod dinosaurs is mainly recorded from the Upper Jurassic of North America, Europe, and Africa. Our understanding of this evolutionary stage is far from complete, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. A partial skeleton of a large sauropod from the Upper Jurassic Ca\~{n}ad\'{o}n Calc\'{a}reo Formation of Patagonia was originally described as a 'cetiosaurid' under the name Tehuelchesaurus benitezii. The specimen is here redescribed in detail and the evidence presented indicates that this taxon is indeed a neosauropod, thus representing one of the oldest records of this clade in South America. A complete preparation of the type specimen and detailed analysis of its osteology revealed a great number of features of phylogenetic significance, such as fully opisthocoelous dorsal vertebrae, the persistence of true pleurocoels up to the first sacral vertebra, associated with large camerae in the centrum and supraneural camerae, and an elaborate neural arch lamination, including two apomorphic laminae in the infradiapophyseal fossa. The phylogenetic relationships of this taxon are tested through an extensive cladistic analysis that recovers Tehuelchesaurus as a non-titanosauriform camarasauromorph, deeply nested within Neosauropoda. Camarasauromorph sauropods were widely distributed in the Late Jurassic, indicating a rapid evolution and diversification of the group. {\copyright} 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 163, 605–662.}},

The group is geographically restricted to Gondwana and Europe, and is particularly diverse in the lower Upper Cretaceous of South America. In this subcontinent, Early Cretaceous forms are solely represented by Amazonsaurus and Zapalasaurus, being the former the putative basalmost rebbachisaurid known. Here, we provide a revised description of the sauropod from the Lohan Cura Formation (Aptian?Albian) that was previously identified as Limaysaurus sp. The new information available (mainly based on new elements) allows us to recognise a new taxon, Comahuesaurus windhauseni gen. et sp. nov. The phylogenetic analysis carried out retrieved this taxon as a relatively basal form of rebbachisaurid, well separated from Limaysaurinae. In this phylogenetic context, the new taxon revealed the presence of a reduced hyposphene?hypantrum system in rebbachisaurids more derived than Histriasaurus, which is completely lost only in Limaysaurinae. Finally, a biogeographical scenario for rebbachisaurids is analysed through the use of a Dispersal, Extinction and Cladogenesis analysis, which retrieves a South American origin for this linage, and a fast dispersion to Africa and Europe during the Hauterivian?Barremian.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract The discovery of a new naraoiid nektaspid in the Upper Silurian (Pridolian) of southeastern Ontario significantly extends the range of this unusual group. Nektaspids are nonmineralized arthropods typical of Early and Middle Cambrian soft-bottom communities, but were thought to have become extinct in the Late Ordovician. The unique holotype specimen of Naraoia bertiensis n. sp. comes from a Konservat?Lagerst\"{a}tte deposit renowned for its eurypterid fauna (the Williamsville Member of the Bertie Formation). Naraoia bertiensis lacks thoracic segments and is morphologically similar to Naraoia compacta from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale, save for the presence of a long ventral cephalic doublure and a subtly pointed posterior shield. To examine the phylogenetic relationships of the new naraoiid, we coded characters of the holotype specimen and of nine previously described nektaspids. The results confirm a sister taxon relationship between Naraoia compacta and Naraoia bertiensis and the monophyly of nektaspid forms lacking thoracic segments (family Naraoiidae). This latter group may have arisen from an ancestral segment-bearing form through heterochronic loss of thoracic segments early in the Cambrian. The disjunct occurrence of a naraoiid nektaspid in the Late Silurian resembles the reappearance of other ?Lazarus taxa? that were thought to have been eliminated during mass extinction events. The naraoiid lineage survived the Late Ordovician biotic crisis, but in this case the ?Lazarus effect? seems likely to be taphonomic in origin.}},

The specimen, Gargoyleosaurus parkpini gen. et sp. nov., was collected from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of Wyoming, USA. Despite its geological age, the skull shows features seen in Late Cretaceous ankylosaurs, including fusion of bone armour to the surface of the skull and mandible and closure of two skull openings, the antorbital and upper temporal fenestrae. The new taxon also has characters common to the two ankylosaur families, the Ankylosauridae and Nodosauridae1, 2, 3, 4, supporting the proposal that the Ankylosauria originated from a single ancestor2, 3, 4.

  Abstract                 = {{The tooth taxon Aublysodon mirandus was reinstated following the collection of nondenticulate tyrannosaurid premaxillary teeth from late Maastrichtian deposits in western North America. A small skull from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana (the 'Jordan theropod', LACM 28471), that was associated with a nondenticulate premaxillary tooth, was referred to Aublysodon and the diagnosis was revised to include cranial bones. However, the 'premaxillary' tooth of the specimen is actually a maxillary tooth. The small size of Aublysodon crowns, and evidence that some denticles develop late in growth in theropods, indicates that the nondenticulate condition represents immaturity. Therefore, Aublysodon is a nomen dubium. The Jordan theropod was recently designated as the type specimen of Stygivenator molnari. A tyrannosaurid from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana (LACM 23845) was first referred to Albertosaurus cf. A. lancensis and then later became the type specimen of Dinotyrannus megagracilis. On the basis of shared derived characters and a quantitative reconstruction of the growth series of Tyrannosaurus rex, the type specimens of S. molnari and D. megagracilis are juvenile and subadult specimens of T. rex, respectively.

This subadult tyrannosauroid is the most complete non-avian theropod collected and described from the Cretaceous of eastern North America. In contrast to tyrannosaurids, the new taxon possesses several plesiomorphic characters, including lacrimals that lack a distinct peaked cornual process, and a dorsoventrally shallow horizontal ramus of the maxilla. Autapomorphies include a wide jugal process of the ectopterygoid, a caudal pneumatic foramen of the palatine that pierces the rostral half of the vomeropterygoid process of the bone, an articular surface for the lacrimal on the palatine that is distally positioned on the dorsolateral process, and pedal unguals that have a distinct proximodorsal lip over the articular surface. Cladistic analysis indicates the new taxon is a basal tyrannosauroid and its presence in eastern North America suggests that the recent common ancestor of Tyrannosauridae probably evolved following the transgression of the Western Interior Seaway. Cladistic analysis indicates that Dryptosaurus aquilunguis is also a basal tyrannosauroid but is less derived than the new genus.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Tetanuran theropods represent the majority of Mesozoic predatory dinosaur diversity and the lineage leading to extant Aves. Thus their history is relevant to understanding the evolution of dinosaur diversity, Mesozoic terrestrial ecosystems, and modern birds. Previously, the fragmentary and poorly sampled fossil record of basal (non-coelurosaur) tetanurans led to uncertainties regarding their basic interrelationships. This in turn prevented determining the relationships of many incompletely known taxa that nonetheless document a global radiation spanning more than 120 million years. We undertook an exhaustive examination of all basal tetanurans and all existing character data, taking advantage of recent discoveries and adding new morphological, temporal and geographic data. Our cladistic analysis of 61 taxa achieved significantly improved phylogenetic resolution. These results position several ?stem? taxa basal to a succession of monophyletic clades (Megalosauroidea, Allosauroidea and Coelurosauria). Megalosauroids include nearly 20 taxa arrayed amongst a basalmost clade (Piatnitzkysauridae, fam. nov.) and the sister taxa Spinosauridae and Megalosauridae; the latter includes two subfamilies, Megalosaurinae and Afrovenatorinae subfam. nov. Allosauroidea contains a diverse Metriacanthosauridae (= Sinraptoridae), Neovenatoridae, Carcharodontosauridae and a reduced Allosauridae. Finally, we assessed more than 40 fragmentary forms and hundreds of additional reported tetanuran occurrences. Tetanuran evolution was characterized by repeated acquisitions of giant body size and at least two general skull forms, but few variations in locomotor morphology. Despite parallel diversification of multiple lineages, there is evidence for a succession of ?dominant? clades. Tetanurae first appeared by the Early Jurassic and was globally distributed by the Middle Jurassic. Several major clades appeared prior to the breakup of Pangaea; as such their absence in specific regions, and at later times, must be due to poor sampling, dispersal failure and/or regional extinction. Finally, we outline a general perspective on Mesozoic terrestrial biogeography that should apply to most clades that appeared before the Late Jurassic.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Here we redescribe the holotype and only specimen of Segisaurus halli, a small Early Jurassic dinosaur and the only theropod known from the Navajo Sandstone. Our study highlights several important and newly recognized features that clarify the relationships of this taxon. Segisaurus is clearly a primitive theropod, although it does possess a tetanuran-like elongate scapular blade. Nonetheless, it appears to be a coelophysoid, based on the presence of a pubic fenestra, a long and ventrally curved pubis, and some pelvic (and possibly tarsal) fusion. Segisaurus does possess a furcula, as has now been observed in other coelophysoids, thus strengthening the early appearance of this ?avian? feature. The absence of an external fundamental system in bone histology sections and the presence of sutural contact lines in the caudal vertebrae, scapulocoracoid, and (possibly) between the pubis and ischium support the inference that this specimen is a subadult, neither a true juvenile nor at full skeletal maturity. A cladistic analysis confirms Segisaurus as a coelophysoid theropod. Poor resolution within Coelophysoidea makes speculation about evolution in this clade difficult, but Segisaurus apparently represents a lineage that had been distinct from Coelophysis and Syntarsus since at least the Carnian.}},

  Abstract                 = {{SYNOPSISRecent discoveries and analyses have drawn increased attention to Ceratosauria, a taxonomically and morphologically diverse group of basal theropods. By the time of its first appearance in the Late Jurassic, the group was probably globally distributed. This pattern eventually gave way to a primarily Gondwanan distribution by the Late Cretaceous. Ceratosaurs are one of several focal groups for studies of Cretaceous palaeobiogeography and their often bizarre morphological developments highlight their distinctiveness. Unfortunately, lack of phylogenetic resolution, shifting views of which taxa fall within Ceratosauria and minimal overlap in coverage between systematic studies, have made it difficult to explicate any of these important evolutionary patterns. Although many taxa are fragmentary, an increase in new, more complete forms has clarified much of ceratosaur anatomy, allowed the identification of additional materials and increased our ability to compare specimens and taxa. We studied nearly 40 ceratosaurs from the Late Jurassic\&\#8211;Late Cretaceous of North and South America, Europe, Africa, India and Madagascar, ultimately selecting 18 for a new cladistic analysis. The results suggest that Elaphrosaurus and its relatives are the most basal ceratosaurs, followed by Ceratosaurus and Noasauridae + Abelisauridae (= Abelisauroidea). Several additional forms were identified as noasaurids, including Genusaurus. Within Abelisauridae, our analysis reveals a clade including Majungasaurus and the Indian forms, as well as a more weakly supported clade comprising Carnotaurus and Ilokelesia. These results greatly clarify the sequence of character acquisition leading to, and within, Abelisauroidea. Thanks to new noasaurid materials (particularly Masiakasaurus), numerous formerly ambiguous characters can now be resolved as either abelisaurid, noasaurid or abelisauroid synapomorphies. Skull and forelimb shortening, for example, now appear to be features confined to Abelisauridae. Nevertheless, a great deal of phylogenetic resolution is lacking, particularly among noasaurids, which hampers attempts to glean meaningful biogeographical information from the phylogeny. As a result, temporal and geographical sampling biases are probably contributing to the apparent patterns in the data and we suggest that definitive answers must await new discoveries. None of the recent ceratosaurian discoveries bear directly on the controversy surrounding latest Cretaceous ceratosaur biogeography.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT We describe the osteology of the new small theropod dinosaur Masiakasaurus knopfleri, from the Late Cretaceous Maevarano Formation of northwestern Madagascar. Approximately 40\% of the skeleton is known, including parts of the jaws, axial column, forelimb, pelvic girdle, and hind limb. The jaws of Masiakasaurus are remarkably derived, bearing a heterodont, procumbent dentition that is unknown elsewhere among dinosaurs. The vertebrae are similar to those of abelisauroids in the reduction of the neural spine, lack of pleurocoelous fossae on the centrum, and extensively pneumatized neural arch. The limb skeleton is relatively gracile and bears numerous abelisauroid synapomorphies, including a rounded humeral head, peg-and-socket iliac-pubic articulation, prominent femoral medial epicondyle, expanded tibial cnemial crest, and double-grooved pedal unguals. The femora and tibiae show evidence of dimorphism. More specific features shared between Masiakasaurus, the Argentine Noasaurus, and the Indian Laevisuchus suggest that these taxa form a clade (Noasauridae) within Abelisauroidea. This is supported by a cladistic phylogenetic analysis of 158 characters and 23 theropod taxa. Additionally, Ceratosauria is rendered paraphyletic in favor of a sister-taxon relationship between Neoceratosauria and Tetanurae that is exclusive of Coelophysoidea. The unique dental and jaw specializations of Masiakasaurus suggest deviation from the typical theropod diet. Finally, the distribution of noasaurids further supports a shared biogeographic history between South America, Madagascar, and India into the Late Cretaceous.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Parsimony analysis suggests derivation of the Bivalvia from monoplacophorans rather than from rostroconchs, and additionally indicates that a phylogenetic classification of the Bivalvia can be achieved by erecting the superorder Nuculaniformii nov. and the order Nuculanoida nov. for the superfamily Nuculanoidea; relegating all other palaeotaxodonts to the superorder Nuculiformii; restricting the order Nuculoida to the families Nuculidae and Pristiglomidae; expanding the order Solemyoida to include ctenodontid genera as basal plesions; restricting the superorder Heteroconchia to palaeoheterodonts and heterodonts, exclusive of the Modiomorphidae; relegating the new family Evyanidae, the Colpomyidae, Matheriidae and Modiolodontidae to near-basal plesion status within the superorder Pteriomorphia; restricting the Mytiloida to the superfamily Mytiloidea, inclusive of modiolopsid genera as basal plesions; placing Ortonella as a basal plesion within the Cyrtodontoida; expanding the order Pectinoida to include the Myodakryotidae and the suborders Limina and Pectinina; and expanding the superfamily Arcoidea to include the frejid genera and Catamarcaia as basal plesions, and the family Glyptarcidae. Modiomorphid anomalodesmatans appear to be more closely related to the Pteriomorphia than to the Heteroconchia, and Evyana lies close to the common ancestry of modiomorphids and colpomyid pteriomorphians. Arcoids may have evolved from left-right symmetrical but otherwise rhombopteriid-like ancestors, rather than from actinodontoids or directly from cyrtodontids. The new family Eodonidae is proposed to distinguish the nacreous genus Eodon from the non-nacreous Astartidae within the superfamily Crassatelloidea.}},

  Abstract                 = {{New hadrosaurid material is recorded from Fontllonga (Ager syncline, province of Lleida), in the Catalonian Pyrenees, comprising a dentary with part of the dental battery, recovered from Late Maastrichtian strata (Tremp Formation), close to the presumed Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary. This hadrosaurid is more derived than is Telmatosaurus transsylvanicus from the Ha\c{t}eg Basin (Romania), but lacks a number of features that diagnose the clade Hadrosaurinae plus Lambeosaurinae. It is attributed to the Euhadrosauria on the basis of the following synapomorphies: dentary teeth not recurved distally, narrow dentary crowns, and denticles not supported by subsidiary ridges. The phylogenetic relationships of the best-known iguanodontids and hadrosauroids are evaluated using mandibular and dentary tooth characters. On the basis of a cladistic analysis, the family of Hadrosauridae is diagnosed by more than 29 dentary tooth positions, parallel-sided vertical furrows formed by dentary alveoli, and absence of caudal secondary ridges. Within Hadrosauridae, successive sister-groups of Hadrosaurinae plus Lambeosaurinae are the Fontllonga taxon and Telmatosaurus. The clade Hadrosaurinae plus Lambeosaurinae is characterised mainly by a coronoid process inclined rostrally and by the absence of secondary ridges on dentary crowns. The Fontllonga find suggests the diversity of European hadrosaurids at the end of the Cretaceous to have been greater than previously thought. Moreover, the primitive character of European hadrosaurids as compared to western North American and Asian relatives may be explained in terms of geographical isolation during the Late Cretaceous.}},

This discovery, which consists of skull, mandible, and postcranial remains from the Tremp Basin (Lleida Province, Catalonia), is particularly unexpected because lambeosaurines are otherwise well known from western North America and central and eastern Asia. Originally named Pararhabdodon isonensis, a species previously regarded as a basal iguanodontian dinosaur, new material indicates that Pararhabdodon is in fact a primitive member of the lambeosaurine clade. The presence of lambeosaurines on the Iberian Peninsula at the very end of the Cretaceous period is likely due to vicariance rather than dispersal. The distribution of hadrosaurids suggests biogeographic differences across the European archipelago at the end of the Cretaceous.}},

This species was historically allocated to Propraopus, but the inclusiveness and monophyly of that genus are uncertain. A new phylogenetic analysis groups D. punctatus with the living species of Dasypus in a monophyletic clade for the genus, also supporting a Propraopus clade composed of P. sulcatus and the type species P. grandis. The palatal anatomy corroborates previously suggested affinities between D. kappleri and D. punctatus. On the contrary, the possible synonymy between P. grandis and P. sulcatus needs further investigation, given that they differed on a single character. As usual in cingulate systematics, characters related to osteoderm ornamentation proved essential to determine the relationships of taxa. However, their use requires careful sampling in order to account for intraspecific variation biases.}},

Phylogenetic analysis found robust support for placing Sauroniops among the basal carcharodontosaurids and related to Eocarcharia, showed that some of the unusual features of the new theropod were convergently acquired by abelisaurids, and revealed a mosaic pattern in the evolution of the carcharodontosaurid skull table. The frontals of Sauroniops and Carcharodontosaurus, both from the 'Kem Kem compound assemblage' of Morocco, show comparable size but differ in the extent of the naso–frontal articulation, the shape and disposition of the prefrontal and lacrimal articulations, the development of dorsal ornamentation and the morphology of the supratemporal fossa. Among carcharodontosaurids, the skull table developed unique configurations among each lineage and appears diagnostic at the species-level.

The specimen is preserved in the reddish, nodular limestone of the Rosso Ammonitico Veronese Formation (Bajocian–Tithonian); new data on microfossil associations constrain the age of the metriorhynchid to the late Bajocian–earliest Bathonian. On the basis of cranial synapomorphies, the ” Portomaggiore crocodile” falls as the closest sister-taxon of the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous geosaurines, and is referred to Neptunidraco ammoniticus gen. et sp. nov. It is unique among Middle Jurassic metriorhynchids in showing an incipient streamlining of the skull, shared with Late Jurassic and Cretaceous taxa.

  Abstract                 = {{We describe a new species of lungfish, Ferganoceratodus martini sp. nov., based on a single specimen discovered in the Late Jurassic – Early Cretaceous of the Phu Nam Jun locality, north-eastern Thailand. The material comprises an almost complete skull roof with associated upper and lower jaws, as well as some postcranial remains. F. martini shows characters unexpected and/or unknown in other Mesozoic lungfishes, such as pieces of a 'hard snout'. The microstructure of the 'hard snout' provides support to the Bemis and Northcutt interpretation of the cosmine tissue of Palaeozoic lungfishes as homologous to the complex cutaneous vasculature of the living Neoceratodus. Because the homologies of the ossifications of the skull roof among lungfishes and among piscian sarcopterygians are unsatisfactorily understood, we use a topological nomenclature in the description of the specimen and in the discussion of post-Devonian dipnoan skull roof characters. We define a few characters for the cladistic analysis only, but these are regarded as less theory-laden. We propose a hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships for most of the post-Devonian forms known by skull remains. The main feature is the ancient dichotomy between the Neoceratodus lineage and most of the other Mesozoic forms, including the Lepidosirenids. The palaeobiogeographical pattern shows a series of vicariant events between Laurasia and Gondwana in the Late Triassic – Early Jurassic, followed by a vicariant event between Africa and South America. {\copyright} 2007 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2007, 149, 141–177.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The oldest known fossil bird from the Late Triassic (about 225 million years ago) Dockum Formation of Texas, provides insights into the anatomy, evolution and phylogenetic relationships of early birds. In life, this adult bird was about the size of a pheasant (Phasianus) counting its long bony tail. Many characters of the skull show that the Texas species is more closely related to other birds than to any known group of archosaurs. The skull is lightly built, pneumatized, with an enormous orbit and expanded temporal region. The teeth are restricted to the tip of the jaws, the posterior teeth having been lost. The temporal region is modified from the diapsid condition, as in modern birds, where the orbit is confluent with the upper and lower temporal openings because of the breakdown of the temporal arcades. The relatively large brain size and the modification of the brain architecture in avian fashion show neurosensory specializations that may be associated with balance, coordination, flight, agility and high metabolic activity. The new species had binocular vision, which suggests that it was a visually oriented predator. Auditory acuity may be associated with vocal behaviour. The quadrate was streptostylic and the whole upper jaw was moved prokinetically as in modern birds. Among current hypotheses for the relationships of birds among archosaurs, both theropod and crocodilian hypotheses have been supported by shared apomorphies. Some of the avian features in the crocodilian skull may have been acquired convergently because of homoplasy. Conversely, the highly akinetic skull and monimostylic quadrate along with primitive brain architecture in early crocodylomorphs negate its close phyletic relationships with birds. Within archosaurs, the theropods are closest to birds, but just what taxon is the sister group among theropods is uncertain at this time. Numerical cladistic analysis of 30 cranial characters generated a hypothesis of the phylogenetic pattern of early avian evolution. By using theropods and sphenosuchids as comparative outgroups and root for the tree, the analysis confirms the monophyly of the class Aves. Archaeopteryx is the most primitive taxon and is sister group to all other birds. Archaeopteryx, Avimimus and the Texas bird are successively closer to the remaining avian taxa or Ornithurae. Hesperornis, Ichthyornis and Gobipteryx are the Cretaceous representatives of the Ornithurae. The Triassic bird extends the known avian record back at least 75 million years and documents an early stage in the evolution of modern birds. The avian skull evolved in response to two functional requirements: efficient feeding mechanism, leading to the development of cranial kinesis, and neurosensory specializations leading to the enlargement of the braincase and orbit. Cranial kinesis, braincase inflation and otic specialization greatly modified the architecture of early avian skulls from the theropod condition. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that theropods shared a common ancestry with birds, but it is indeterminate from the fossil record whether or not the immediate common ancestor itself was a theropod.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT A new Middle Triassic sauropterygian, Qianxisaurus chajiangensis, gen. et sp. nov., is described on the basis of a skeleton from the Zhuganpo Member (Ladinian) of the Falang Formation, Xingyi, southwestern Guizhou Province, China. It is primarily characterized by a premaxilla with eight teeth, marginal teeth with a slightly constricted peduncle and short conical crown, snout longer than the rest of skull, postorbital with a truncated dorsal process and forked posterior process, a very small supratemporal fenestra, a short retroarticular process posteriorly truncated and lacking a dorsal concavity, an elongate trunk with 28 vertebrae, a stout sacrum with four vertebrae, a longitudinal groove on proximodorsal surface of the dorsal ribs, and a coracoid with a narrow lateral portion and a foot-shaped medial portion. Q. chajiangensis appears similar to the European pachypleurosaurs, but a global phylogenetic analysis failed to support close relationships with these taxa. Instead, Q. chajiangensis is an eosauropterygian and most probably the sister group of a clade consisting of the European pachypleurosaurs and the Nothosauroidea. The discovery of Q. chajiangensis certainly enriches our knowledge of the early history of the Eosauropterygia and leads to a better understanding of the phylogenetic relationships among known eosauropterygians.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Isolated, well-preserved silicified sclerites of an unusually diverse Silurian paleoloricate assemblage from Gotland preserve morphological features that are important in interpreting palaeobiology. The typically granular dorsal ornament is comparable with Recent chitons, and is hence possibly linked functionally with sensory aesthetes. Ventral structures particularly in thickened shells indicate major muscle attachment sites sub-apically or, equivalently, beneath the rim of the apical area, and also marginally. In early chitons such as Cambrian Matthevia, deep ventral cavities represent comparable sub-apical sites. Three Gotland genera with an unusual, holoperipheral shell growth style apparently represent plated aplacophorans (cf. Acaenoplax), which coexisted with paleoloricate chitons in shallow inshore carbonate shelf environments. Sclerite features of all the Gotland genera are discussed together since they share most characteristics. The new family Heloplacidae includes those genera and Acaenoplax, which in a preliminary cladistic analysis form a sister group to other Lower Palaeozoic paleoloricates. Multiplated skeletons in paleoloricates and this group of aplacophorans represent parallel evolution of dorsal armour, which in chitons resulted in overlapping, articulating sclerites. The diversity of the mid-Silurian Gotland assemblage is examined against early evolutionary diversification of polyplacophorans, aplacophorans, and in relation to the overall record of Palaeozoic paleoloricate and neoloricate chitons. Peaks in diversity in early Ordovician, mid-Silurian and early Carboniferous times correspond to periods with widespread development of low latitude carbonate shelves. Neoloricates, apparently with an additional shell layer that contributed articulatory plates, appeared in the Devonian from where the fossil record remains poorly known.}},

The tarsometatarsal structure of Neuquenornis refers it to the Late Cretaceous family Avisauridae. The structure of the wing and pectoral girdle of Neuquenornis indicates that it was an active flyer, an aptitude also inferred for the El Brete enantiornithines from the Upper Cretaceous Lecho Formation of northwestern Argentina.

Here we describe a new taxon that is closely related to Mononykus 2,3. This new taxon is represented by two exquisitely preserved skulls — the first known for Alvarezsauridae — details of which support the theory that the group is related to birds4,5. This theory was first put forward on the basis of primarily postcranial evidence2,3, including the presence of avian characteristics such as the absence of a contact between the jugal and postorbital, and between the quadratojugal and squamosal, articulations. Other earlier evidence that suggested that the alvarezsaurids were birds included the presence of a movable joint between the quadratojugal and quadrate, separate squamosal and braincase articulations of the quadrate, confluence between the caudal tympanic recess and columellar recess, a triradiate palatine, an unusually large foramen magnum, and the loss of a coronoid bone. The configuration of the temporal region of the skull and its articulation with the rostrum indicate the capability for prokinetic movement in which flexing occurs at the junction of the upper jaw and neurocranium, and support the idea that prokinesis preceded other types of avian intracranial kinesis.}},

Several synapomorphies nest the new bird within an enantiornithine clade of proficient fliers, but the anatomy and proportions of its flight apparatus imply significant aerodynamic restrictions. The combination of phylogeny and our functional interpretation suggests that this new fossil bird is a representative of a flightless lineage. This discovery thus provides the first evidence of a trend towards more limited flying capabilities among Enantiornithes, a group of Cretaceous birds otherwise believed to be represented by competent fliers.}},

This material represents the only bone-bed deposition of a basal neoceratopsian currently known, and in addition is almost entirely disarticulated allowing for a more thorough understanding of basal neoceratopsian cranial morphology. The new taxon is characterized by a lower, more sloping head than in Leptoceratops, with a nasal that is pinched caudally, a wide, triangular jugal, extremely gracile surangular, and reduced articular among other autapomorphies. A preliminary cladistic analysis unites Prenoceratops firmly with the other North American basal neoceratopsians (and one Asian taxon) in the clade Leptoceratopsidae.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Basal (cladistically) neoceratopsians are relatively small, gracile members of Ceratopsia (?horned? dinosaurs), which also includes larger forms such as Triceratops and Centrosaurus. The Asian basal neoceratopsians share some very important traits not found in any North American group until now, including a fenestrated frill and premaxillary teeth. Likewise, the North American basal taxa have some traits not found in the Asian forms, the most important of which is a very specialized tooth wear pattern. Cerasinops hodgskissi, a new basal neoceratopsian from the Lower Two Medicine River Formation of Montana, exhibits all of the above characters along with others previously found on only one of the two continents. The new species is a sister group to Leptoceratopsidae in a cladistic analysis, and is a link between the taxa on the two continents. Cerasinops also exhibits extremely interesting anatomical and histological features that indicate the possibility of bipedality in this taxon, a locomotor pattern not found previously in basal neoceratopsians (it has been suggested in some, but with little evidence).}},

Results of a cladistic analysis of eight basal neoceratopsians (Protoceratops, Leptoceratops, Bagaceratops, Microceratops, Breviceratops, Montanoceratops, Asiaceratops, and Udanoceratops) and four ceratopsids (Centrosaurus, Anchiceratops, Chasmosaurus, and Styracosaurus) confirm Montanoceratops as the sister group of Ceratopsidae. Microceratops and Asiaceratops are positioned at the base of Neoceratopsia. Protoceratops, Leptoceratops, and Udanoceratops constitute a monophyletic Protoceratopsidae. Paleogeographical interpretation of the cladogram suggests that Neoceratopsia originated in Asia, and that there were at least two migrations of ceratopsians from Asia to North America.}},

A phylogenetic analysis of theropod relationships places Aorun as a basal member of the Coelurosauria. Although the sole use of a sub-adult ontogenetic exemplar is potentially problematic for phylogenetic reconstruction, we show that the phylogenetic position of Aorun as a member of Coelurosauria is robust to the exclusion of characters known to change during theropod ontogeny. Aorun is the seventh theropod taxon, and temporally oldest coelurosaur, known from the Shishugou Formation, which has one of the most taxonomically diverse Jurassic coelurosaurian theropod faunas in the world.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:5CC73577-9EB3-47AB-9983-1677B278EFFD}},

Here we describe the first complete sauropod skull from the Cretaceous of the Americas, Abydosaurus mcintoshi, n. gen., n. sp., known from 104.46 ± 0.95\&nbsp;Ma (megannum) sediments from Dinosaur National Monument, USA. Abydosaurus shares close ancestry with Brachiosaurus, which appeared in the fossil record ca. 45 million years earlier and had substantially broader teeth. A survey of tooth shape in sauropodomorphs demonstrates that sauropods evolved broad crowns during the Early Jurassic but did not evolve narrow crowns until the Late Jurassic, when they occupied their greatest range of crown breadths. During the Cretaceous, brachiosaurids and other lineages independently underwent a marked diminution in tooth breadth, and before the latest Cretaceous broad-crowned sauropods were extinct on all continental landmasses. Differential survival and diversification of narrow-crowned sauropods in the Late Cretaceous appears to be a directed trend that was not correlated with changes in plant diversity or abundance, but may signal a shift towards elevated tooth replacement rates and high-wear dentition. Sauropods lacked many of the complex herbivorous adaptations present within contemporaneous ornithischian herbivores, such as beaks, cheeks, kinesis, and heterodonty. The spartan design of sauropod skulls may be related to their remarkably small size—sauropod skulls account for only 1/200th of total body volume compared to 1/30th body volume in ornithopod dinosaurs.}},

Despite this, understanding of tetrapod evolution has been hampered by a 20-million-year gap ('Romer's Gap'3) that covers the crucial, early period when many key features of terrestrial tetrapods were acquired. Here I describe the only articulated skeleton of a tetrapod, Pederpes, yet found from the Tournaisian epoch (354–344 million years ago (Myr)). The new taxon includes a pes with five robust digits, but a very small, possibly supernumerary digit preserved on the manus suggests the presence of polydactyly. Polydactylous early tetrapods may have survived beyond the end of the Devonian and pentadactyly cannot be assumed for the pes. However, the pes has characteristics that distinguish it from the paddle-like feet of the Devonian forms and resembles the feet of later, more terrestrially adapted Carboniferous forms. Pederpes is the earliest-known tetrapod to show the beginnings of terrestrial locomotion and was at least functionally pentadactyl. With its later American sister-genus, Whatcheeria 4, 5, it represents the next most primitive tetrapod clade after those of the Late Devonian, bridging the temporal, morphological and phylogenetic gaps that have hitherto separated Late Devonian and mid-Carboniferous tetrapod faunas.}},

Growth of Eucritta skulls approaches isometry, and lies on the same trajectory as skulls belonging to the genus Baphetes. The function of the temporal embayment is discussed; it was probably not associated with an air-borne hearing device. The axial skeleton of Eucritta was ossified in larger specimens. Ribs in Eucritta gain expanded distal ends with growth, and the animal probably breathed by buccal pumping. An updated cladistic analysis is presented, incorporating data from a fifth specimen. Eucritta remains as a probable basal baphetid, but the sister group to the baphetids remains uncertain.}},

A revised interpretation of the naris shows it in most respects to be like that of other Carboniferous tetrapods, lacking both an anterior tectal and a lateral rostral. However it does incorporate an enlarged septomaxilla, and part of the dorsal surface of the vomer is also visible within the naris of most specimens. Prominent paired buttresses run along the midline of the snout, and a single bowl-shaped interpremaxillary fenestra pierces the snout and palate but is not confluent with the naris or choana. A preopercular is probably absent. A new cladistic analysis places Crassigyrinus with the Vis\'{e}an genus Whatcheeria, and puts those two taxa as a sister-clade to the anthracosaurs Proterogyrinus and Pholiderpeton. Temnospondyls form a clade with loxommatids, and these two arms form a dichotomy crownward to Greererpeton, Ichthyostega and Acanthostega which are successive stemward plesions.}},

The most cursorial of these fossils3, 4, 5, 6 are small, gracile forms often grouped together as the Sphenosuchia, with fully erect, slender limbs; their relationships, however, are poorly understood5, 7, 8, 9, 10. A new crocodylomorph from deposits in northwestern China of the poorly known Middle Jurassic epoch possesses a skull with several adaptations typical of living crocodylians. Postcranially it is similar to sphenosuchians but with even greater adaptations for cursoriality in the forelimb. Here we show, through phylogenetic analysis, that it is the closest relative of the large group Crocodyliformes, including living crocodylians. Thus, important features of the modern crocodylian skull evolved during a phase when the postcranial skeleton was evolving towards greater cursoriality, rather than towards their current semi-aquatic habitus.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract Charles Darwin commented that Ichthyornis, as one of the ?toothed birds? from the Late Cretaceous of Kansas, offered some of ?the best support to the theory of evolution? (in litt., C. Darwin to O.C. Marsh, August 31, 1880). Ichthyornis figures no less prominently today. It is one of the closest outgroups to crown clade Aves, and remains one of the only Mesozoic avialans known from more than a handful of specimens. As such, Ichthyornis is an essential taxon for analyses of deep divergences within Aves because of its influence in determining the morphologies ancestral to the crown clade. Ichthyornis, however, has languished in need of new anatomical description and taxonomic revision. Many of the best Ichthyornis specimens were largely inaccessible, plastered into Yale Peabody Museum (YPM) exhibit mounts for nearly a century. The focus of this study was the entire YPM Ichthyornis collection, the largest at any institution. The elements removed from the mounts were identified to the specimens with which they were originally associated. Detailed morphological study of the 81 YPM specimens yielded the following results: (1) there is evidence for only one species of Ichthyornis, rather than the eight previously proposed; (2) 78 specimens are part of this species, Ichthyornis dispar; (3) two previously identified species are not part of Ichthyornis; and (4) one new species is identified. This analysis also provided a case study in the application of phylogenetic nomenclature at the species level. The morphology of Ichthyornis dispar is described in detail from the holotype and referred specimens. Phylogenetic analyses of 202 morphological characters, scored for 24 terminal taxa, evaluated the relationships among Mesozoic ornithurines including Ichthyornis dispar and the newly identified taxa. Analysis of 23 core taxa produced two most parsimonious trees (L: 384, CI: 0.66). Marsh's ?Ichthyornithiformes? is not monophyletic: Two previously named species of Ichthyornis as well as Apatornis celer are placed as more closely related to or as part of Aves. The results of the phylogenetic analyses have implications for previous hypotheses of the timing and pattern of the origin of Aves.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract A new bird from the Late Cretaceous of Patagonia (Argentina), known from associated wing elements, is described and its phylogenetic position evaluated. Fossil taxa as well as representatives of species of extant birds sampled from lineages considered to be basal within the crown clade were included in a cladistic analysis of 72 characters primarily from the thoracic limb. Based on the results of the phylogenetic analysis and identification of autapomorphies in the specimen, we name a new taxon Limenavis patagonica. Limenavis patagonica is identified as closer to the crown clade than Enantiornithes by the presence of three unambiguous synapomorphies: a fossa (sometimes with two distinguishable subparts) on the dorsal, distalmost extremity of the humerus; distal fusion of metacarpals II and III; and an extensor process on metacarpal I. It is placed closer to the crown clade than Ichthyornis, and, thus, unambiguously as a carinate (see Methods for terminology), by two further synapomorphies: the abruptly truncate contact of the dorsal trochlear surface of the ulna with the ulnar shaft and the loss of a tubercle adjacent to the tendinal groove on the distal ulna. Finally, Limenavis patagonica is diagnosed by three autapomorphies: the attachment of the pars ulnaris of the trochlea humeroulnaris on the proximal ulna developed as a pit-shaped fossa; the location of the pisiform process with its proximal surface at approximately the same level as the proximal surface of metacarpal I; and a scar of the ligamentum collaterale ventrale of the ulna proximodistally elongate and extending down the caudal margin of the brachial impression. Limenavis patagonica is placed just outside the avian crown clade. The shortest tree with the new taxon as part of the crown clade is five steps longer than the most parsimonious topology. Se describe una nueva especie de ave del Cret\'{a}cico tard\'{\i}o de Patagonia (Argentina), cuyo \'{u}nico ejemplar se encuentra representado por elementos del miembro tor\'{a}cico, y se eval\'{u}a su posici\'{o}n filogen\'{e}tica. Varios taxones f\'{o}siles, a la vez que representantes de linajes actuales considerados de posici\'{o}n basal, fueron inclu\'{\i}dos en un an\'{a}lisis clad\'{\i}stico de 72 caracteres, principalmente caracteres del miembro tor\'{a}cico. Sobre la base de los resultados de este an\'{a}lisis filogen\'{e}tico y la identificaci\'{o}n de autapomorf\'{\i}as en el ejemplar aqui descripto, se erige el nuevo tax\'{o}n Limenavis patagonica. Tres sinapormof\'{\i}as de optimizaci\'{o}n no ambigua indican que Limenavis patagonica esta m\'{a}s cercanamente emparentado con el ?crown clade? (el grupo compuesto por el ancestro com\'{u}n de todas las aves vivientes m\'{a}s todos sus descendientes) de lo que lo est\'{a}n los Enantiornithes. Estas sinapomorf\'{\i}as comprenden la presencia de una fosa (a veces diferenciada en dos) en la parte dorsal de la extremidad m\'{a}s distal del humero, la fusi\'{o}n distal de los metacarpos II y III, y la presencia de un proceso extensor del metacarpo I. Otras dos sinapomorf\'{\i}as indican que Limenavis patagonica se encuentra m\'{a}s cercanamente emparentado al ?crown clade? que Ichthyornis, y que por lo tanto puede ser reconocido de forma no ambigua como un Carinatae (ver ?Methods? para aspectos nomenclatoriales). Estas dos sinapomorf\'{\i}as son el contacto abrupto entre la superficie troclear dorsal y la di\'{a}fisis de la ulna, y la p\'{e}rdida de un tub\'{e}rculo adyacente al surco tendinal en el extremo distal de \'{e}ste \'{u}ltimo hueso. Finalmente, tres autapomorf\'{\i}as diagnostican a Limenavis patagonica: la inserci\'{o}n de la pars ulnaris de la troclea humeroulnaris del extremo proximal de la ulna desarrollada en forma de una peque\~{n}a fossa, la presencia de un proceso pisiforme cuya superficie proximal se encuentra a m\'{a}s o menos el mismo nivel que la superficie proximal del metacarpo I, y la forma proximodistalmente elongada de la inserci\'{o}n del ligamento colateral ventral de la ulna, que se extiende a lo largo del m\'{a}rgen caudal de la impresi\'{o}n braquial. Los resultados del an\'{a}lisis clad\'{\i}stico indican que Limenavis patagonica se encuentra justo por fuera del ?crown clade.? El \'{a}rbol m\'{a}s corto que incluye a este nuevo tax\'{o}n dentro del ?crown clade? es cinco pasos m\'{a}s largo que aqu\'{e}l con la topolog\'{\i}a m\'{a}s parsimoniosa.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The study of morphological evolution after the inferred origin of active flight homologous with that in Aves has historically been characterized by an emphasis on anatomically disjunct, mosaic patterns of change. Relatively few prior studies have used discrete morphological character data in a phylogenetic context to quantitatively investigate morphological evolution or mosaic evolution in particular. One such previously employed method, which used summed unambiguously optimized synapomorphies, has been the basis for proposing disassociated and sequential ” modernizing” or ” fine-tuning” of pectoral and then pelvic locomotor systems after the origin of flight ( ” pectoral early–pelvic late” hypothesis). We use one of the most inclusive phylogenetic data sets of basal birds to investigate properties of this method and to consider the application of a Bayesian phylogenetic approach. Bayes factor and statistical comparisons of branch length estimates were used to evaluate support for a mosaic pattern of character change and the specific pectoral early–pelvic late hypothesis. Partitions were defined a priori based on anatomical subregion (e.g., pelvic, pectoral) and were based on those hypothesized using the summed synapomorphy approach. We compare 80 models all implementing the Mk model for morphological data but varying in the number of anatomical subregion partitions, the models for among-partition rate variation and among-character rate variation, as well as the branch length prior. Statistical analysis reveals that partitioning data by anatomical subregion, independently estimating branch lengths for partitioned data, and use of shared or per partition gamma-shaped among-character rate distribution significantly increases estimated model likelihoods. Simulation studies reveal that partitioned models where characters are randomly assigned perform significantly worse than both the observed model and the single-partition equal-rate model, suggesting that only partitioning by anatomical subregion increases model performance. The preference for models with partitions defined a priori by anatomical subregion is consistent with a disjunctive pattern of character change for the data set investigated and may have implications for parameterization of Bayesian analyses of morphological data more generally. Statistical tests of differences in estimated branch lengths from the pectoral and pelvic partitions do not support the specific pectoral early–pelvic late hypothesis proposed from the summed synapomorphy approach; however, results suggest limited support for some pectoral branch lengths being significantly longer only early at/after the origin of flight.}},

Here we report three new avialan specimens from the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) of Omnogov Aimag, Mongolia. These fossils were collected from the Nemegt Formation exposed at the locality of Tsaagan Khushu in the southern Gobi Desert. All of the new finds are partial isolated bones with a limited number of preserved morphologies; however, they further understanding of dinosaur diversity in the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia and, specifically, from the Nemegt Formation. The new specimens are described and evaluated in phylogenetic analyses. These analyses indicate that all three fossils are placed as part of the clade Ornithurae. Avialan diversity of the Nemegt Formation is reviewed and briefly compared with that of the underlying Djadokhta and Barun Goyot Formations. These formations have been considered to represent at least two distinct Late Cretaceous environments, with the Nemegt typically interpreted as representing more humid conditions. Ornithurine and enantiornithine birds are known from the Nemegt as well as the Djadokhta and Barun Goyot Formations, although ornithurine remains are more common in the Nemegt. No avialan species known from the Djadokhta, or Barun Goyot, are also known from the Nemegt Formation and, overall, the avialan taxa from these formations do not appear more closely related to each other than to other avialans. Whether these faunal differences are best interpreted as environmental, temporal, or sampling/preservational should be further investigated.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract The avialan taxon Apsaravis ukhaana from the Late Cretaceous of southern Mongolia is completely described and its phylogenetic position is evaluated. Apsaravis ukhaana is from continental sandstones exposed at the locality of Ukhaa Tolgod, Omnogov Aimag, Mongolia. The holotype specimen consists of the nearly complete, articulated skeleton of a small volant avialan. Apsaravis ukhaana is unambiguously differentiated from other avialans based on the presence of several unique morphologies: a strong tubercle on the proximal humerus, a hypertrophied trochanteric crest on the femur, and extremely well-projected posterior wings of a surface of the distal tibiotarsus that in Aves articulates with the tibial cartilage. Ten other homoplastic characters optimize as autapomorphies of Apsaravis ukhaana in the phylogenetic analysis. They are as follows: ossified mandibular symphysis; dentary strongly forked posteriorly; hooked acromion process on scapula; highly angled dorsal condyle of humerus; humeral condyles weakly defined; distal edge of humerus angling strongly ventrally; humerus flared dorsoventrally at its distal terminus; lateral condyle of tibiotarsus wider than medial one; neither condyle of tibiotarsus tapering toward the midline; and metatarsal II trochlea rounded rather than ginglymoid. Phylogenetic placement of Apsaravis ukhaana as the sister taxon of Hesperornithes + Aves resulted from analysis of 202 characters scored for 17 avialan ingroup taxa. The implications of Apsaravis ukhaana, and the results of the phylogenetic analysis, for the evolution of flight after its origin and character support for enantiornithine monophyly are extensively discussed.}},

Inferences from biogeography4, 8 and molecular sequence data2, 3, 5, 9 (but see ref. 10) project major avian lineages deep into the Cretaceous period, implying their 'mass survival'3 at the K/T boundary. By contrast, it has been argued that the fossil record refutes this hypothesis, placing a 'big bang' of avian radiation only after the end of the Cretaceous1, 6. However, other fossil data—fragmentary bones referred to extant bird lineages11, 12, 13—have been considered inconclusive1, 6, 14. These data have never been subjected to phylogenetic analysis. Here we identify a rare, partial skeleton from the Maastrichtian of Antarctica15 as the first Cretaceous fossil definitively placed within the extant bird radiation. Several phylogenetic analyses supported by independent histological data indicate that a new species, Vegavis iaai, is a part of Anseriformes (waterfowl) and is most closely related to Anatidae, which includes true ducks. A minimum of five divergences within Aves before the K/T boundary are inferred from the placement of Vegavis; at least duck, chicken and ratite bird relatives were coextant with non-avian dinosaurs.}},

  Abstract                 = {{In studies of the evolution of avian flight there has been a singular preoccupation with unravelling its origin. By contrast, the complex changes in morphology that occurred between the earliest form of avian flapping flight and the emergence of the flight capabilities of extant birds remain comparatively little explored. Any such work has been limited by a comparative paucity of fossils illuminating bird evolution near the origin of the clade of extant (i.e. 'modern') birds (Aves). Here we recognize three species from the Early Cretaceous of China as comprising a new lineage of basal ornithurine birds. Ornithurae is a clade that includes, approximately, comparatively close relatives of crown clade Aves (extant birds) and that crown clade. The morphology of the best-preserved specimen from this newly recognized Asian diversity, the holotype specimen of Yixianornis grabaui Zhou and Zhang 2001, complete with finely preserved wing and tail feather impressions, is used to illustrate the new insights offered by recognition of this lineage. Hypotheses of avian morphological evolution and specifically proposed patterns of change in different avian locomotor modules after the origin of flight are impacted by recognition of the new lineage.

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT A nearly complete specimen of a new coelacanth is described from the Oxfordian of Burgundy, France. Wenzia latimerae, gen. et sp. nov., shares unique features with both the extant coelacanth Latimeria and the Mesozoic coelacanth Macropoma. It displays a unique combination of primitive characters (such as the presence of a spiracular bone and postparietal pit-lines), and derived characters (such as a postparietal shield with raised areas and very short relatively to the parietonasal shield; a consolidated snout bearing large tubercles; a deeply excavated postorbital with a long and tubular ventral expansion; a squamosal with an anterior expansion for the jugal sensory canal). A cladistic analysis suggests that the new species is the fossil sister taxon to Latimeria, but this close relationship is weakly supported. Nevertheless, Wenzia latimerae belongs with confidence to the Latimeriidae. The new specimen also provides information on the structure of the calcified plates of the ossified swim bladder, as well as on the structure of the muscle fibres. Part of the diet of this marine coelacanth is known thanks to the presence of a small crustacean in its stomach contents.}},

Inference of evolutionary trends (e.g., modification of body shape and skull morphology) from the phylogenetic patterns demonstrates that the morphology of actinistians is less conservative than has been proposed previously. This empirical cladistic approach supports two distinct tempos of evolution during an evolutionary history of 380 million years. Along a phylogenetic pathway originating with a Devonian stem-species and ending with the living Latimeria chalumnae (including 101 morphological changes and 18 cladogenetic events), the first tempo occurred during the Devonian — Permian periods as a decreasing rate of morphological changes, which was followed by a stabilizing tempo during the Permian — Recent periods. The decreasing tempo is characterized by a sequence of gradual versus quantum temporal changes and low versus faster rates, whereas the stabilizing tempo primarily is gradual and low. In contrast to a common assumption, no significant correlation was found between the rates of morphological evolution and the temporal diversity of species.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACTThe postcranial skeleton of Acanthostega gunnari from the Famennian of East Greenland displays a unique, transitional, mixture of features conventionally associated with fishand tetrapod-like morphologies. The rhachitomous vertebral column has a primitive, barely differentiated atlas-axis complex, encloses an unconstricted notochordal canal, and the weakly ossified neural arches have poorly developed zygapophyses. More derived axial skeletal features include caudal vertebral proliferation and, transiently, neural radials supporting unbranched and unsegmented lepidotrichia. Sacral and post-sacral ribs reiterate uncinate cervical and anterior thoracic rib morphologies: a simple distal flange supplies a broad surface for iliac attachment. The octodactylous forelimb and hindlimb each articulate with an unsutured, foraminate endoskeletal girdle. A broad-bladed femoral shaft with extreme anterior torsion and associated flattened epipodials indicates a paddle-like hindlimb function. Phylogenetic analysis places Acanthostega as the sister-group of Ichthyostega plus all more advanced tetrapods. Tulerpeton appears to be a basal stemamniote plesion, tying the amphibian-amniote split to the uppermost Devonian. Caerorhachis may represent a more derived stem-amniote plesion. Postcranial evolutionary trends spanning the taxa traditionally associated with the fish-tetrapod transition are discussed in detail. Comparison between axial skeletons of primitive tetrapods suggests that plesiomorphic fish-like morphologies were re-patterned in a cranio-caudal direction with the emergence of tetrapod vertebral regionalisation. The evolution of digited limbs lags behind the initial enlargement of endoskeletal girdles, whereas digit evolution precedes the elaboration of complex carpal and tarsal articulations. Pentadactylous limbs appear to have stabilised independently in amniote and amphibian lineages; the colosteid Greererpeton has a pentadactylous manus, indicating that basal amphibian forelimbs may not be restricted to patterns of four digits or less.}},

Approximately the same size as Giganotosaurus carolinii Coria \& Salgado, 1995, Mapusaurus roseae n. gen., n. sp. is characterized by many features including a deep, short and narrow skull with relatively large triangular antorbital fossae, relatively small maxillary fenestra, and narrow, unfused rugose nasals. Mapu- saurus roseae n. gen., n. sp. has cervical neural spines and distally tapering epipo- physes, tall dorsal neural spines, central pleurocoels as far back as the first sacral vertebra, accessory caudal neural spines, stout humerus with poorly defined distal condyles, fused metacarpals, ilium with brevis fossa extending deeply into ischial peduncle, and femur with low fourth trochanter. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Mapusaurus n. gen. shares with Carcharodontosaurus Stromer, 1931 and Giganotosaurus Coria \& Salgado, 1995 several derived features that include narrow blade-like teeth with wrinkled enamel, heavily sculptured fa- cial bones, supraorbital shelf formed by a postorbital/palpebral complex, and a dorsomedially directed femoral head. Remains of Mapusaurus n. gen. were recovered from a bonebed where 100\% of the identifiable dinosaur bones can be assigned to this new genus. Based on the metatarsals recovered, a minimum of seven individuals was buried at the site. It is conceivable that this bonebed represents a long term or coincidental accumulation of carcasses. The presence of a single carnivorous taxon with individuals of different ontogenic stages pro- vides evidence of variation within a single population, and may also indicate some behavioural traits for Mapusaurus roseae n. gen., n. sp.}},

These include the development of a broad frontoparietal skull table that forms a shelf overhanging the supratemporal fenestra, the reorientation of the metotic fissure and fenestra ovalis onto the occiput, the ventral extension of the supraoccipital on either side of the foramen magnum, a broad but low occipital condyle, and pneumatization of the basioccipital. Some characters suggest affinities with South American abelisaurids, but many support a sister grouping of Giganotosaurus and Carcharodontosaurus within a larger group that includes the Asian sinraptorids. The close affinities of Giganotosaurus with the northern African Carcharodontosaurus support the hypothesis of intercontinental connections until mid-Cretaceous times.}},

  Abstract                 = {{A new ornithopod dinosaur from Antarctica, Trinisaura santamartaensis n. gen. et n. sp. is diagnosed by a unique combination of characters that includes a scapula with a spike-like acromial process with a strong and sharp lateral crest and longer than other ornithopods, a humerus with a rudimentary deltopectoral crest represented as a thickening on the anterolateral margin of the humerus, and shaft strongly bowed laterally, and an ischium gently curved along its entire length. The holotype specimen comprises vertebral and appendicular elements. The presence of axially elongate distal caudal vertebrae, pubis with long prepubic and postpubic processes, as well as a femur with a distinct anterior trochanter, pendant 4th trochanter and shallow anterior intercondylar groove constitute a combination of characters present in the Late Cretaceous Patagonian Gasparinisaura, Anabisetia and Talenkahuen. The materials were found on the surface enclosed in a hard sandstone concretion collected near the Santa Marta Cove, James Ross Island, from the lower levels of the Snow Hill Island Formation (Campanian). This is the first ornithopod taxon identified from this unit, and the second ornithischian dinosaur, after the ankylosaur Antarctopelta oliveroi. However, other ornithopod reports from nearby localities of James Ross and Vega islands in outcrops of the overlying Lopez de Bertodano Formation suggest that this clade was widely represented in the Campanian and Maastrichtian of the James Ross Basin, Antarctic continent. \^{a}º We describe a new Ornithopoda dinosaur from Antarctica, Trinisaura santamartaensis. \^{a}º Trinisaura increases our knowledge about the Antarctic dinosaur diversity. \^{a}º Trinisaura is the first Ornithopoda species identified from the Snow Hill Island Formation. \^{a}º Trinisaura and other Ornithopoda reports suggest predominance of this group in Antarctica.}},

Consideration of fossil ontogeny provides an additional source of data and a broader evolutionary perspective on the evolution of arthropod body patterning. Here, I examine the development of the thoraco-pygidial exoskeleton of three related phacopine trilobites from the Upper Devonian according to the integrated ontogenetic scheme proposed by Hughes et al. Pygidial shields assigned to three ontogenetic series gave us the opportunity to further explore the evolutionary pattern of the trilobite segmentation. The analysis showed a different mode of development in two of three species and thus reveals variability between the related taxa. Comparison of the boundaries of different aspects of ontogenesis ratifies the diversity of the segmentation process among trilobites and even among related phacopine species. Results include (i) in a synarthromeric trunk condition recorded to date, there has consistently been a preceding ?equilibrium? phase for the late meraspid pygidium and (ii) two developmental modes, i.e. both hypoprotomeric development and synarthromeric development, occur contemporaneously in closely related taxa. Such developments suggest that aspects of segmental development such as segment accretion and segment articulation were able to vary in a labile manner.}},

Only when a criterion or set of criteria for hypothesizing homologies is established can the calcichordate theory be tested against its main rival—the Stylophoran theory—by applying the principle of parsimony. The criterion of topological similarity is applied to a three-laxon problem involving a mitrate, the crown-group Echinodermata and the crown-group Chordata. The mitrate shares more features with extant chordates than with extant echinoderms and the calcichordate theory is supported by a simple parsimony analysis. In a cladistic analysis of the cornutes, four monophyletic families are recognized (Cothurnocystidae, Scotiaecystidae, Phyllocystidae and Hanusiidae) and their interrelationships resolved using Hennig86 and the successive-weighting procedure of Farris. Because the known fossil record of cornutes and mitrates is very poor, the correlation between the cladogram produced for cornutes and their order of appearance in the geological record is weak. All of the cornute families must have originated in the Lower Cambrian at the latest.}},

This new lambeosaurine hadrosaurid is characterized by a jugal combining a hook-like dorsal edge of the posterior process and a narrow, D-shaped infratemporal fenestra. Blasisaurus differs from Arenysaurus from the Blasi 3 site of Ar\'{e}n mainly by the absence of secondary ridges in the dentary teeth, and from Koutalisaurus (probably a junior synonym of Pararhabdodon) from the Isona region of Lleida by the anteriormost portion of the dentary that is modestly deflected ventrally. A phylogenetic analysis places Blasisaurus as closely related to Arenysaurus in a clade of basal lambeosaurines more derived than Tsintaosaurus and Jaxartosaurus; this clade forms part of a polytomy with Amurosaurus and with more derived lambeosaurines. Palaeobiogeographically, the presence of Blasisaurus and other hadrosaurids in the Maastrichtian European archipelago suggests one or, more probably, a series of dispersal events from Asia across intermittent land bridges during the second half of the Late Cretaceous.}},

The discovery of a partial articulated skeleton in floodplain deposits at N\&\#259;la\&\#355;-Vad, preserving parts of the vertebral column and pelvic girdle, allows for the first time a more detailed understanding of the axial anatomy of the Romanian titanosaurs. The specimen is described as a new taxon, Paludititan nalatzensis gen. et sp. nov., based on several autapomorphies: presence of an accessory anterior centrodiapophyseal lamina in the posterior dorsals; dorsal segments of the anterior and posterior centrodiapophyseal laminae parallel in posterior dorsals; presence of amphiplatyan mid-caudal vertebrae within the procoelous series; anterior caudal vertebrae with narrow neural spines showing anteriorly projecting anterodorsal corner, and presence of a posterolateral buttress on the iliac peduncle of the ischium. The description of Paludititan supports a higher titanosaurian diversity in the Ha\&\#355;eg assemblage than previously recognized, and will contribute to the clarification of the taxonomic status of Magyarosaurus, the only titanosaur previously described from the area, and its included species. Phylogenetic analyses of Paludititan show it is a relatively derived titanosaur, but yields equivocal results as to its more precise systematic position and relationships, depending on the dataset used. These preliminary results suggest that development of a standard dataset for cladistic analyses should represent one of the major tasks of sauropod systematics.}},

Late Cretaceous vertebrate assemblages of Romania and elsewhere in Europe are classic examples of island faunas in the fossil record, and are characterized by dwarfed herbivorous dinosaurs and other endemic taxa that are noticeably primitive relative to their mainland contemporaries. Fossils of the predators inhabiting the European paleoislands, however, are exceptionally rare and fragmentary. We describe a new dromaeosaurid theropod, based on an articulated skeleton from the Maastrichtian of Romania, which represents the most complete predatory dinosaur from the middle to Late Cretaceous of Europe. This taxon is characterized by a peculiar body plan, most notably extensive fusion in the hand and distal hindlimb, a highly retroverted pelvis with enlarged femoral muscle attachments, and a pair of hyperextensive pedal claws. However, unlike the island-dwelling herbivorous dinosaurs, its closest relatives are contemporary similar-sized Laurasian taxa, indicating faunal connections between Asia and the European islands late into the Cretaceous. This theropod provides support for the aberrant nature of the Late Cretaceous European island-dwelling dinosaurs, but indicates that predators on these islands were not necessarily small, geographically endemic, or primitive.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Bonebeds can provide a wealth of anatomical, taphonomic, and ontogenetic information about the specimens preserved within them, and can provide evidence for inferred behavior. The material described here represents the first known bonebed of ornithomimids in North America, and the fourth record of an ornithomimosaur bonebed in the world. Partial skeletons representing three individuals are preserved in this assemblage, each comprising primarily portions of the posterior postcrania (pelvis, hind limbs and tail). All three individuals are morphologically similar, although one is larger in overall size. Given the stratigraphic position of the site, and the morphology of the postcrania, the preserved material represents a taxon from the clade containing Ornithomimus and Struthiomimus. Pedal ungual morphology is examined and found to be too variable to be useful in distinguishing these species taxonomically. This site provides additional evidence of gregarious behavior in ornithomimids and the first probable record of that behavior in North American forms.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Dromaeosaurus albertensis was one of the first small theropods described that was based on reasonably good cranial material. It was realized from the beginning that this animal was significantly different from other Cretaceous theropods, and the Dromaeosauridae was created for its inclusion. In the intervening years, a number of genera were assigned to this family, which came to assume an important position in discussions on theropod relationships and evolution, and the origin of birds. It is now known that many of the dromaeosaurids are different enough from Dromaeosaurus to be included in a distinct subfamily known as the Velociraptorinae. In spite of intensive collecting activity, the holotype of Dromaeosaurus albertensis is still the most complete specimen, and it is apparent that this genus is even rarer than other small theropods. Repreparation and restudy of the holotype has produced new anatomical information useful for evaluating the relationships of dromaeosaurids. Contrary to previous reports, the premaxillary teeth are not D-shaped in section, the cranium is not pneumatic, there are interdental plates, and the braincase bones are not pneumatized. Dromaeosaurids form a distinct clade of specialized, successful theropods that are not closely related to other ?coelurosaurs? of the Late Cretaceous.}},

Here we describe the most complete titanosaur yet discovered. Rapetosaurus krausei gen. et sp. nov., from the Maevarano Formation of Madagascar, provides a view of titanosaur anatomy from head to tail. A total-evidence phylogenetic analysis supports a close relationship between brachiosaurids and titanosaurs (Titanosauriformes10, 11, 12, 13). The inclusion of cranial data from Rapetosaurus also lays to rest questions concerning the phylogeny of the enigmatic Mongolian genera Nemegtosaurus and Quaesitosaurus14, 15. In spite of their elongated, diplodocoid-like skulls, all three taxa are now firmly nested within Titanosauria.}},

Superficial hemispherical to hemi-ellipsoidal pits on the larval and/or mature shells are interpreted as casts of deformable, membrane-bound vesicles of mucus or rigid vesicles of glycoproteins or GAGs with thickened coats. Flat-bottomed, sub-circular imprints characterize acrotheloids and many acrotretides, and could be impressions of biconvex tablets of apatite like those exocytosed within the primary layer of the obolid 'Lingulella'? antiquissima, whilst the rhomboidal imprints of the Paterula shell could have held tablets of proteinaceous silica like those of living discinid larvae. The ancestral fabric of the linguloid secondary layer was probably composed of rubbly and virgose sets, but trellised rods of apatite (baculation) are characteristic of most linguloids and also acrotheloids. This condition was suppressed in shells identified as 'Lingula' from at least the Early Carboniferous to the present day. In early Palaeozoic acrotretides and lingulellotretids, columnar and camerate fabrics evolved in place of baculation. Baculation in Discinisca tenuis and Glottidia pyramidata is associated with the amino acids glutamic acid, glycine, alanine, arginine and proline which may be components of an organic polymer axial to baculate accretion.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT In 1989, TMP 89.127.3, a basal ichthyopterygian, was collected as a counterpart slab from the Vega-Phroso Siltstone Member (Lower Triassic) of the Sulphur Mountain Formation in east-central British Columbia, Canada. Previous investigations of its postcranial skeleton resulted in ambiguous taxonomic affinities, with it being identified as either Grippia cf. longirostris or Parvinatator wapitiensis. More recently, the part slab of TMP 89.127.3 was collected and prepared, revealing important new cranial data that permits its systematic relationships to be more thoroughly assessed and previously proposed taxonomic affinities to be tested. By integrating both cranial and postcranial data, phylogenetic analysis recovers TMP 89.127.3 and Grippia as members of Grippidia, nested within Eoichthyosauria. TMP 89.127.3 can be distinguished from Grippia by possessing the following autapomorphies: metacarpal I with a notched peripheral shaft; cylindrical anterior teeth with a crown shape index >5.0; and a postfrontal-frontal contact at the rostral limit of the anterior margin of the supratemporal terrace. A new taxon, Gulosaurus helmi, is erected to accommodate this suite of features. The placement of Gulosaurus helmi within Grippidia reaffirms the Early Triassic distribution of this clade to include western and northern Laurasia, which is represented by outcrop in present-day Canada and Norway (Spitzbergen), respectively.

Although the holotype of the species lacks a well-preserved cranium, UHR 30691 preserves a near-complete skull and may be referred to Utatsusaurus based on a similar geologic occurrence and, most importantly, the following shared features with the holotype: subthecodont tooth implantation; the presence of distomesially compressed tooth crowns; a humerus that is longer than wide; and an ulnar facet on the humerus that is as wide as the radial facet. The first complete description of the skull of UHR 30691 and the incorporation of data derived from it into a phylogenetic analysis retrieves a monophyletic Ichthyopterygia that is supported by 18 unambiguous synapomorphies. The updated analysis recovers Utatsusaurus in a basal clade with Parvinatator (united by one unambiguous feature), which collectively form the sister group to all other ichthyopterygians.

  Abstract                 = {{Early Cretaceous sauropods were among the first dinosaurs discovered in North America, but several aspects of their taxonomy and evolution remain poorly understood. Much of this ambiguity stems from lack of anatomical overlap among taxa and the 125-year-long taxonomic confusion surrounding the sauropods Astrodon and Pleurocoelus. New discoveries have begun to remedy the first problem, but a lack of autapomorphies in their holotypes and skeletal associations among their hypodigms renders Astrodon johnstoni, Pleurocoelus altus and Pleurocoelus nanus nomina dubia. Herein I examine the affinities of sauropods from the Trinity Group of Texas and Oklahoma previously referred to as ?Pleurocoelus? or ?Astrodon?. Some of this material currently comprises the genera Paluxysaurus and Sauroposeidon from laterally equivalent strata in Texas and Oklahoma, respectively. Although representative individuals of Paluxysaurus are only two-thirds the size of Sauroposeidon, bone histology of Paluxysaurus indicates that the individuals from the type locality were not near adult size. The similar provenance, lack of morphological differences, and shared unique features support referral of Paluxysaurus to Sauroposeidon. Other sauropod remains from the Trinity Group are not referable to ?Pleurocoelus?, ?Astrodon? or Sauroposeidon. Some of these remains comprise the holotype of Astrophocaudia slaughteri gen. et sp. nov., a basal titanosauriform diagnosed by a hyposphene?hypantrum system in the caudal vertebrae. A sauropod hind limb previously referred to ?Pleurocoelus? is instead referable to Cedarosaurus weiskopfae based on shared features of the pes. Cladistic analysis indicates that Astrophocaudia and Sauroposeidon are members of Somphospondyli, whereas Cedarosaurus is a brachiosaurid. The Trinity Group of Texas and laterally equivalent Antlers Formation of Oklahoma exhibit similar dinosaur faunas at the generic and specific levels to the Cloverly Formation of Wyoming. This homogeneity with respect to latitude stands in marked contrast to the latitudinal variation in dinosaur communities that developed later in the Cretaceous. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:FE82D372-7ADA-4870-9572-3A3F607D39CE}},

  Abstract                 = {{Titanosauriformes was a globally distributed, long-lived clade of dinosaurs that contains both the largest and smallest known sauropods. These common and diverse megaherbivores evolved a suite of cranial and locomotory specializations perhaps related to their near-ubiquity in Mesozoic ecosystems. In an effort to understand the phylogenetic relationships of their early (Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous) members, this paper presents a lower-level cladistic analysis of basal titanosauriforms in which 25 ingroup and three outgroup taxa were scored for 119 characters. Analysis of these characters resulted in the recovery of three main clades: Brachiosauridae, a cosmopolitan mix of Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous sauropods, Euhelopodidae, a clade of mid-Cretaceous East Asian sauropods, and Titanosauria, a large Cretaceous clade made up of mostly Gondwanan genera. Several putative brachiosaurids were instead found to represent non-titanosauriforms or more derived taxa, and no support for a Laurasia-wide clade of titanosauriforms was found. This analysis establishes robust synapomorphies for many titanosauriform subclades. A re-evaluation of the phylogenetic affinities of fragmentary taxa based on these synapomorphies found no body fossil evidence for titanosaurs before the middle Cretaceous (Aptian), in contrast to previous reports of Middle and Late Jurassic forms. Purported titanosaur track-ways from the Middle Jurassic either indicate a substantial ghost lineage for the group or – more likely – represent non-titanosaurs. Titanosauriform palaeobiogeographical history is the result of several factors including differential extinction and dispersal. This study provides a foundation for future study of basal titanosauriform phylogeny and the origins of Titanosauria. {\copyright} 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2012, 166, 624–671.}},

Although the body scales, fin rays, lower jaw and palate are comparable to those in more primitive sarcopterygians, the new species also has a shortened skull roof, a modified ear region, a mobile neck, a functional wrist joint, and other features that presage tetrapod conditions. The morphological features and geological setting of this new animal are suggestive of life in shallow-water, marginal and subaerial habitats.}},

It lived on an island developed on a carbonate platform in the Tethys Ocean and the small size of the specimens suggests that it may be an insular dwarf. The skeleton has many peculiarities including cursorial adaptations, and a mix of derived and primitive features. European hadrosauroids probably did not evolve by vicariance nor did they colonize the European Archipelago from North America, but rather came from Asia by island hopping.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The Mastodonsauroidea, previously and more widely known as the Capitosauroidea, ranks among the most common and best known Mesozoic terrmospondyls. Mastodonsauroids exhibit wide morphological variation and significant homoplasy and their taxonomy and relationships have been in a state of flux. Since the first description of a mastodonsauroid there have been 56 genera and 118 species proposed. A comprehensive review of all these taxa has reduced the content of the group to 14 genera and 44 species. Most species previously included in the Mastodonsauroidea are undiagnostic at the generic level and designated incertae sedis within the Mastodonsauridae, Heylerosauridae, Mastodonsauroidea or Stereospondyli. Where applicable, definitions, diagnoses and a list of synonyms of all fully diagnosable taxa within the Mastodonsauroidea are given. A computer-based phylogenetic analysis of mastodonsauroid temnospondyls based on 47 cranial characters and 25 terminal taxa was performed. The analysis included the 14 genera of mastodonsauroids as well as selected well-known members of the Ly-dekkerinidae and Trematosauridae. The results supported a monophyletic Mastodonsauroidea with Benthosuchus as the sister group to a clade consisting of the Heylerosauridae and the Mastodonsauridae. The name Mastodonsauridae replaces the name 'Capitosauridae', because Mastodonsaurus was found to fall within the clade that includes most of the traditional 'capitosaurid' genera. The composition of the Mastodonsauroidea was shown to be similar to that traditionally assumed for the 'Capitosauroidea', and to exclude the Rhinesuchidae, a group often placed within the 'Capitosauroidea'. The Mastodonsauroidea must have a ghost lineage extending back to at least the Late Permian, when the common ancestor of the Mastodonsauroidea and the Trematosauroidea diverged from rhinesuchid ancestors. We can therefore expect to find Late Permian representatives of the Mastodonsauroidea, perhaps present as inconspicuous elements of non-stereospondyl dominated Late Permian faunas.}},

Biostratigraphic data for this new locality of Sainte-Eulalie suggest a middle Ypresian age. The new species is the oldest representative of the Palaeotheriidae, here including the controversial pachynolophs. The abundant remains of this taxon from a single locality allow the recognition of a high degree of unsuspected variability within this taxon, including sexual dimorphism, thus permitting discussion of the reliability of commonly used characters. A phylogenetic analysis led us to emend the diagnosis of the genus Pachynolophus as well as to suggest the exclusion of ?Pachynolophus? hookeri from the genus. This study proposes new hypotheses of relationships among the basal Equoidea and allows us to distinguish the two main groups (Equidae and Palaeotheriidae) earlier in the Eocene, close to the reference level MP8?9. The new material appears to be a fundamental cornerstone in solving the question of the controversial systematics and phylogeny of pachynolophs. It also sheds new light on the temporal and spatial distribution of the initial radiation of European equoids.

It differs from other therizinosauroids in having a shallow, poorly demarcated glenoid fossa with a prominent rounded and striated tumescence on the dorsomedial surface of its scapular portion, and a pubis with a strongly concave cranial margin. It represents a new taxon, Suzhousaurus megatherioides gen. et sp. nov. Cladistic analysis recovers Suzhousaurus as the sister taxon of Nothronychus mckinleyi from the mid-Cretaceous of western North America; together, they are basal members of the Therizinosauroidea, more derived than the Early Cretaceous Falcarius and Beipiaosaurus but less derived than Alxasaurus and the Therizinosauridae. Along with ” Nanshiungosaurus” bohlini from possibly coeval beds in the Mazongshan area of northern-most Gansu, Suzhousaurus represents one of the largest-known Early Cretaceous therizinosauroids, demonstrating that this clade attained considerable body size early in its evolutionary history.}},

The phylogenetic affinities of this taxon were assessed by adding it into an existing morphological data set of 224 taxa coded for 364 characters. The effects of character ordering and scoring on tree topology and the composition of Gekkonomorpha were also explored. The results of the analysis indicate that Gekkonomorpha is highly unstable and additional revision of stem gekkotans (e.g., Parviraptor, Gobekko) is required to refine the basal relationships of this clade. Like modern gekkotans, Hoburogekko possess a tubular frontal bone. In contrast to extant gekkotans, the Meckelian canal is only partially fused and may represent an incipient form of the gekkotan condition. The posterior shelf of the maxilla is wider than in modern gekkotans, perhaps related to a plesiomorphically large jugal. The short, rounded snout may indicate a lifestyle as found in some modern gekkotans found in equivalent xeric environments to the inferred paleoenviroment of the H\"{o}\"{o}vor (Mongolia) locality during the Early Cretaceous.}},

  Abstract                 = {{A new species, Goniopholis kiplingi sp. nov., based on an exceptionally preserved skull from the Lower Cretaceous of England is described in detail. It shows great similarity with Goniopholis simus and Goniopholis baryglyphaeus, but can be distinguished by the presence of longer lachrymals, smooth (not edged) dorsal surface of the quadrate, and proportionally longer rostrum. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Mesoeucrocodylia (104 taxa; 486 characters) focused on goniopholidids (14 species) places G. kiplingi as sister-group of G. simus, and as part of a monophyletic group also containing G. baryglyphaeus. The relationships of Nannosuchus gracilidens and three undescribed European taxa are explored, and preliminary analyses of Denazinosuchus kirtlandicus (Upper Cretaceous, USA) and 'Goniopholis' phuwiangensis (Lower Cretaceous, Thailand) are presented. The assignment of taxa to the genus Goniopholis is discussed. Goniopholis, in its traditional sense, is considered paraphyletic and a restricted updated definition is proposed, with comments on the evolution of other goniopholidids. Morphological characteristics of fragmentary material attributed to Goniopholis are not considered sufficient to secure their generic/specific assignment, and provide no support for the presence of Goniopholis in Gondwanan and/or Upper Cretaceous sedimentary units. Currently Goniopholis is restricted to the Upper Jurassic−Lower Cretaceous of Europe. {\copyright} 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 163, S66–S108.}},

This new fossil allows us to clearly characterize the skull morphology of A. precedens and to reject the idea, as recently suggested, that the taxon could be considered a nomen dubium. Parsimony analysis confirms earlier phylogenetic hypotheses based on the fragmentary holotype from the Maastrichtian of Valioara in Hat?eg Basin (Romania), as well as on putative conspecific remains from approximately coeval localities in Spain and France: A. precedens is a non-crocodylian eusuchian. However, some relevant morphological traits differ from what was previously reported for this taxon: the external naris is large and anterodorsally directed; the lateral profile of the skull is not festooned in dorsal view; the suborbital fenestrae reach the eighth alveolus; the postorbital bar is not massive and inset from the jugal margin; the skull table is approximately planar or medially concave and does not markedly overhang the supratemporal fenestrae; the exoccipitals are not significantly involved in the basioccipital tubera. Because the condition of most of these characters was unknown in the holotype, the morphology of the taxon was previously evaluated on non-Romanian remains only. The morphological discrepancies between Romanian and western European fossils could suggest the presence of different taxa, possibly of infra-generic rank. Allodaposuchus and presumably Hylaeochampsa are the only eusuchians showing a laterally open cranioquadrate passage.}},

This species differs in several cranial features from Acynodon  iberoccitanus, the only other Acynodon species whose cranial osteology is known in detail. The absence of maxillary and dentary caniniform teeth coupled with the presence of enlarged molariform teeth suggests that Acynodon probably fed on slowly moving hard-shelled prey. Moreover, the new materials reveal for the first time the morphology of some postcranial elements of Acynodon: in particular, medial-most paravertebral osteoderms that are characterized by two keels. A new cladistic phylogenetic analysis resolves the previously reported polytomy among the basal Globidonta: Acynodon is recognized as the most primitive globidontan. This genus may represent the geologically oldest known globidontan. The fact that Acynodon has been found only in Europe and that the outgroup of Globidonta, the Diplocynodontinae, is mainly known from Europe, suggests that globidontans may have originated in Europe and not in North America as previously supposed.}},

Based on a phylogenetic analysis that included the addition of 20 novel scorings for characters previously unavailable for this taxon and the recoding of four additional characters, we found B. deponiae to be nested within Diplocynodon. We propose the new combination Diplocynodon deponiae. The name Baryphracta is thus a junior synonym of Diplocynodon. The small species D. deponiae (?1 m in total length) shares several features with other species of Diplocynodon, including the presence of two subequal alveoli in the maxilla and dentary, exclusion of the splenial from the symphysis, and the shape of the iliac blade. However, it also differs in a few characters, including the presence of molariform teeth and the extension of osteoderms along the limbs and tail. Such osteodermal cover, which developed very early in ontogeny, easily distinguishes even small-sized specimens of D. deponiae from the co-occurring Diplocynodon darwini. The crocodylian fauna of Messel shows an astonishing diversity including at least seven taxa, with two belonging to the same genus. The two congeners exhibit differences in dentition and size that likely allowed for niche partitioning that minimized competition, thereby allowing them to be syntopic.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Until now the Doswelliidae was considered a monospecific family including Doswellia kaltenbachi from the Late Triassic of North America. The phylogenetic position of this taxon remained enigmatic until recently, when a sister-group relationship with the Proterochampsidae was suggested. In the present contribution we describe the new doswelliid species Archeopelta arborensis gen. et sp. nov. from the Middle–Late Triassic of Brazil. A cladistic analysis recovered Archeopelta, Doswellia, and Tarjadia within a monophyletic group of basal archosauriforms, the Doswelliidae. The monophyly of this family is supported by the presence of osteoderm ornamentation that is coarse, incised, and composed of regular pits and the presence of an unornamented anterior articular lamina. Archeopelta is more closely related to Doswellia than to other archosauriforms by the presence of basipterygoid processes anterolaterally orientated, dorsal centra with a convex surface, width of the neural arch plus ribs of the first primordial sacral that are three times the length of the neural arch, and iliac blade laterally deflected, with strongly convex dorsal margin, and a length less than three times its height. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that Doswellidae is the closest large monophyletic entity to Archosauria, which achieved a wide palaeolatitudinal distribution during the late Middle and Late Triassic time span. {\copyright} 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 161, 839–871.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract Four shell types are recognized from strophomenide brachiopods from Anticosti Island based on their fibrous or laminar character and on the type of taleolae. The shell types consistently co-vary with the types of cardinal process and style of socket plates. Treating shell structure as a conservative, non-reversing character implies that there are four groups of strophomenide brachiopod. The laminar-shell strophomenoids probably originated two separate times; one origination giving rise to two groups within the Strophomenida and one origination producing the Orthotetida. This matches the Treatise classification with only minor variation. The fourth group, that with fibrous shell and trilobed cardinal process and which includes the Plectambonitoidea, does not clearly fit into the Strophomenata and may be more closely related to the Clitambonitoidea. A limited cladistic analysis supports the idea that shell structure should be an important factor in establishing evolutionary kinship and points to ways of optimizing the Treatise classification.}},

The euryapsid skull has a distinctive occiput with a prominent supraoccipital process that is flanked by posterior ?horn-like? projections of the squamosals. Postfrontals, tabulars, and postparietals are absent. Plesiomorphic features of the palate and braincase include a plate-like horizontal parabasisphenoid, a pair of foramina for the internal carotid arteries on the ventral surface of the basisphenoid, and two fields of teeth on the palatal surface of the pterygoid. A sharp angle along the cervical and anterior dorsal ribs clearly separates the dorsal and lateral sides of the neck and anterior thoracic region. The posterior thoracic region has shorter ribs that project laterally with only a slight curvature. The ilium has a laterally deflected blade with numerous deep grooves along its distal edge. The laterally extensive set of osteoderms includes a nuchal element that is composed of several interlocking osteoderms that lack the arrangement in distinct transverse rows that characterizes the remainder of the osteoderms. A phylogenetic analysis of basal archosauriforms incorporates new data of Doswellia and the taxa Turfanosuchus, Yonghesuchus, and Qianosuchus that have not previously been combined in a single study. Results include a sister-group relationship between Doswellia and proterochampsids, placement of Qianosuchus as a crurotarsan archosaur, and Yonghesuchus and Turfanosuchus as successive sister taxa to Archosauria.}},

Combination of the phylogenetic relationships of basal archosauromorphs and their known stratigraphic ranges reveals significant gaps in the fossil records of Late Permian and Triassic diapsids.

Markuelia is an exception to this, known from cleavage and pre-hatchling stages as a vermiform and profusely annulated direct-developing bilaterian with terminal circumoral and posterior radial arrays of spines. Phylogenetic analyses have hitherto suggested assignment to stem-Scalidophora (phyla Kinorhyncha, Loricifera, Priapulida). We test this assumption with additional data and through the inclusion of additional taxa. The available evidence supports stem-Scalidophora affinity, leading to the conclusion that scalidophorans, cyclonerualians, and ecdysozoans are primitive direct developers, and the likelihood that scalidophorans are primitively metameric.}},

  Abstract                 = {{In a cladistic analysis of Recent seed plants, Loconte and Stevenson (1990) obtained results that conflict with our 1986 analysis of both extant and fossil groups and argued that fossil data had led us to incorrect conclusions. To explore this result and the general influence of fossils on phylogeny reconstruction, we assembled new ” Recent” and ” Complete” (extant plus fossil) data sets incorporating new data, advances in treatment of characters, and those changes of Loconte and Stevenson that we consider valid. Our Recent analysis yields only one most parsimonious tree, that of Loconte and Stevenson, in which conifers are linked with Gnetales and angiosperms (anthophytes), rather than with Ginkgo, as in our earlier Recent and Complete analyses. However, the shortest trees derived from our Complete analysis show five arrangements of extant groups, including that of Loconte and Stevenson and our previous arrangements, suggesting that the result obtained from extant taxa alone may be misleading. This increased ambiguity occurs because features that appear to unite extant conifers and anthophytes are seen as convergences when fossil taxa are interpolated between them. All trees found in the Complete analysis lead to inferences on character evolution that conflict with those that would be drawn from Recent taxa alone (e.g., origin of anthophytes from plants with a ” seed fern” morphology). These results imply that conclusions on many aspects of seed plant phylogeny are premature; new evidence, which is most likely to come from the fossil record, is needed to resolve the uncertainties.}},

  Abstract                 = {{We present a numerical cladistic (parsimony) analysis of seed plants plus progymnosperms, using characters from all parts of the plant body, outgroup comparison, and a method of character coding that avoids biases for or against alternative morphological theories. The robustness of the results was tested by construction of alternative trees and analysis of subsets of the data. These experiments show that although some clades are strongly supported, they can often be related to each other in very different but nearly equally parsimonious ways, apparently because of extensive homoplasy. Our results support Rothwell's idea that coniferopsids are derived fromCallistophyton- like platyspermic seed ferns with saccate pollen, but the hypothesis that they evolved fromArchaeopteris- like progymnosperms and the seed arose twice is nearly as parsimonious. Meyen's division of seed plants into radiospermic and primarily and secondarily platyspermic lines is highly unparsimonious, but his suggestion that ginkgos are related to peltasperms deserves attention. Angiosperms belong among the platyspermic groups, as the sister group of Bennettitales,Pentoxylon, and Gnetales, and this ” anthophyte” clade is best related toCaytonia and glossopterids, although relationships with other combinations of Mesozoic seed fern taxa are nearly as parsimonious. These results imply that the angiosperm carpel can be interpreted as a modified pinnate sporophyll bearing anatropous cupules (=bitegmic ovules), while gnetalian strobili are best interpreted as aggregations of highly reduced bennettitalian flowers, as anticipated by Arber and Parkin and Crane. Our most parsimonious trees imply that the angiosperm line (though not necessarily all its modern features) extended back to the Triassic, but a later derivation of angiosperms from some species ofCaytonia or Bennettitales, which would be nearly as parsimonious, should also be considered. These results raise the possibility that many features considered key adaptations in the origin and rise of angiosperms (insectpollinated flowers, rapid reproduction, drought tolerance) were actually inherited from their gymnospermous precursors. The explosive diversification of angiosperms may instead have been a consequence of carpel closure, resulting in increased speciation rates due to potential for stigmatic isolating mechanisms and/or new means of dispersal. DNA sequencing of extant plants and better information on anatomy, chemistry, sporophyll morphology, and embryology of Bennettitales and Caytoniales and the morphological diversity of Mesozoic anthophytes could provide critical tests of relationships.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Leptocleidus Andrews, 1922 is a poorly known plesiosaur genus from Lower Cretaceous successions of the UK, South Africa, and Australia. Historically, there has been little consensus regarding its phylogenetic position within Plesiosauria, largely because of its seemingly aberrant combination of a relatively small skull and short neck. As a result, a diverse array of potential sister groups have been posited for Leptocleidus, including long-necked Cretaceous elasmosaurids, Early Jurassic ” rhomaleosaurs”, and Middle to Late Jurassic pliosaurids. A cladistic analysis including Leptocleidus, and a new, apparently morphologically similar specimen from Alberta, TMP 94.122.01, was undertaken to assess their phy- logenetic position within Plesiosauria. A character-taxon matrix was assembled afresh, consisting of 33 operational taxonomic units sampled broadly among plesiosaurs. 185 cranial and postcranial characters used in plesiosaur phylogenetics were critically reanalyzed, of which 152 were employed in the parsimony analysis. The results indicate a basal dichotomous split into the traditionally recognized pliosauroid and plesiosauroid clades. Nested within Pliosauroidea, a monophyletic Leptocleididae was recov- ered, consisting of L. superstes Andrews, 1922 and L. capensis (Andrews, 1911a). In contrast to earlier suggestions, Lep- tocleidus neither clusters with Rhomaleosaurus, which was found to be paraphyletic, nor with large-skulled pliosaurid taxa, such as Simolestes. Rather, a sister group relationship between Cretaceous Polycotylidae and Leptocleididae was recovered, which is here named Leptocleidoidea. Although TMP 94.122.01 is superficially similar to Leptocleidus, sev- eral discrete characters of the skull nest this new taxon within Polycotylidae. Compared to other phylogenetic hypotheses of plesiosaurs, these results are more congruent with respect to the stratigraphic distribution of leptocleidoids. A classifi- cation for Plesiosauria is presented.}},

Chelicerates comprise the arachnids (spiders, scorpions, mites, etc.), the extinct eurypterids (sea scorpions) and the xiphosurans (horseshoe crabs). Among Recent groups the limits of the Chelicerata are well defined, i.e. arachnids and xiphosurans, though the position of pycnogonids (sea spiders) remains uncertain (King, 1973). Phylogenetic relationships within the Chelicerata remain unresolved (Weygoldt and Paulus, 1979; van der Hammen, 1989; Shultz, 1990). When fossil taxa are considered, the limits of the Chelicerata become less well constrained. This is especially true of various problematic arthropods: fossils such as aglaspidids (Raasch, 1939), chasmataspids (Caster and Brooks, 1956), Sanctacaris Briggs and Collins, 1988 and other Burgess Shale-type arthropods (see Conway Morris, 1992 for a review).}},

  Abstract                 = {{We present a redescription of Megalocoelacanthus dobiei, a giant fossil coelacanth from Upper Cretaceous strata of North America. Megalocoelacanthus has been previously described on the basis of composite material that consisted of isolated elements. Consequently, many aspects of its anatomy have remained unknown as well as its phylogenetic relationships with other coelacanths. Previous studies have suggested that Megalocoelacanthus is closer to Latimeria and Macropoma than to Mawsonia. However, this assumption was based only on the overall similarity of few anatomical features, rather than on a phylogenetic character analysis. A new, and outstandingly preserved specimen from the Niobrara Formation in Kansas allows the detailed description of the skull of Megalocoelacanthus and elucidation of its phylogenetic relationships with other coelacanths. Although strongly flattened, the skull and jaws are well preserved and show many derived features that are shared with Latimeriidae such as Latimeria, Macropoma and Libys. Notably, the parietonasal shield is narrow and flanked by very large, continuous vacuities forming the supraorbital sensory line canal. Such an unusual morphology is also known in Libys. Some other features of Megalocoelacanthus, such as its large size and the absence of teeth are shared with the mawsoniid genera Mawsonia and Axelrodichthys. Our cladistic analysis supports the sister-group relationship of Megalocoelacanthus and Libys within Latimeriidae. This topology suggests that toothless, large-sized coelacanths evolved independently in both Latimeriidae and Mawsoniidae during the Mesozoic. Based on previous topologies and on ours, we then review the high-level taxonomy of Latimerioidei and propose new systematic phylogenetic definitions.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Allosauroidea has a contentious taxonomic and systematic history. Within this group of theropod dinosaurs, considerable debate has surrounded the phylogenetic position of the large-bodied allosauroid Acrocanthosaurus atokensis from the Lower Cretaceous Antlers Formation of North America. Several prior analyses recover Acrocanthosaurus atokensis as sister taxon to the smaller-bodied Allosaurus fragilis known from North America and Europe, and others nest Acrocanthosaurus atokensis within Carcharodontosauridae, a large-bodied group of allosauroids that attained a cosmopolitan distribution during the Early Cretaceous. Re-evaluation of a well-preserved skull of Acrocanthosaurus atokensis (NCSM 14345) provides new information regarding the palatal complex and inner surfaces of the skull and mandible. Previously inaccessible internal views and articular surfaces of nearly every element of the skull are described. Twenty-four new morphological characters are identified as variable in Allosauroidea, combined with 153 previously published characters, and evaluated for eighteen terminal taxa. Systematic analysis of this dataset recovers a single most parsimonious topology placing Acrocanthosaurus atokensis as a member of Allosauroidea, in agreement with several recent analyses that nest the taxon well within Carcharodontosauridae. A revised diagnosis of Acrocanthosaurus atokensis finds that the species is distinguished by four primary characters, including: presence of a knob on the lateral surangular shelf; enlarged posterior surangular foramen; supraoccipital protruding as a double-boss posterior to the nuchal crest; and pneumatic recess within the medial surface of the quadrate. Furthermore, the recovered phylogeny more closely agrees with the stratigraphic record than hypotheses that place Acrocanthosaurus atokensis as more closely related to Allosaurus fragilis. Fitch optimization of body size is also more consistent with the placement of Acrocanthosaurus atokensis within a clade of larger carcharodontosaurid taxa than with smaller-bodied taxa near the base of Allosauroidea. This placement of Acrocanthosaurus atokensis supports previous hypotheses of a global carcharodontosaurid radiation during the Early Cretaceous.}},

The specimen consists of a partial skeleton from the Upper Jurassic of Portugal, herein considered as Stegosaurus cf. ungulatus. The presence of this plated dinosaur in the upper Kimmeridgian–lower Tithonian Portuguese record and synchronic levels of the Morrison Formation of North America reinforces previous hypothesis of a close relationship between these two areas during the Late Jurassic. This relationship is also supported by geotectonic evidences indicating high probability of an episodic corridor between the Newfoundland and Iberian landmasses. Together, Portuguese Stegosaurus discovery and geotectonic inferences could provide a scenario with episodical faunal contact among North Atlantic landmasses during the uppermost Kimmeridgian–lowermost Tithonian (ca. 148–153 Ma ago).}},

  Abstract                 = {{The cranial anatomy of the helmet-crested lambeosaurine Hypacrosaurus altispinus (Ornithischia: Hadrosauridae) is described, with a focus on ontogenetic and individual variation in phylogenetically significant characters of the cranial crest, braincase, and facial skeleton. Cranial material of H. altispinus represents a relatively complete growth series that includes crestless juveniles of less than half the size of large individuals with fully developed crests. Cranial ontogeny is compared with other lambeosaurines using bivariate morphometrics and through qualitative comparison of a size-standardized cranial growth series. Bivariate analyses reveal that the relative growth of the skull and cranial crest of H. altispinus and H. stebingeri are similar, and that Hypacrosaurus more closely resembles Corythosaurus than Lambeosaurus. Hypacrosaurus altispinus is systematically revised. The taxon is characterized by five autapomorphies, most of which are concentrated in the skull, as well as an enlarged terminal ischial foot. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian likelihood (Mk+gamma) phylogenetic analyses were conducted to test the monophyly of the genus. Hypacrosaurus monophyly is corroborated in light of new anatomical data. Although H. stebingeri and H. altispinus share few derived characters of the skull, the hypothesis that H. stebingeri is a metaspecies that represents the ancestor of H. altispinus cannot be rejected. {\copyright} 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2010, 159, 398–434.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT The first detailed description of the lambeosaurine Lambeosaurus magnicristatus (Ornithischia: Hadrosauridae) confirms that it is a distinct taxon characterized by its comparatively enormous cranial crest, formed predominantly by the caudodorsal process of the premaxilla, and an acute crest-snout angle. The holotype of L. magnicristatus occurs stratigraphically higher than all other Dinosaur Park Formation lambeosaurines at the Dinosaur Provincial Park locality. The only referred specimen was collected over 170 kilometers southeast of the type locality. Correlation of its host stratum with the well-known Dinosaur Park section reveals that L. magnicristatus has no biostratigraphic overlap with L. lambei and suggests that it replaces L. lambei on a regional scale in southern Alberta at the end of ?Dinosaur Park time.? Species-level phylogenetic analysis of Lambeosaurinae corroborates the monophyly of Lambeosaurus. The genus is characterized by five apomorphies, including a procumbent crest, complete enclosure of the ophthalmic canal of the laterosphenoid, the presence of a flange on the caudodorsal process of the premaxilla that overlaps the nasal in the rostral region of the crest, caudal extension of the premaxilla such that it forms the caudal margin of the crest, and a unique joint between the rostral nasal and the caudodorsal process of the premaxilla. Lambeosaurine phylogeny indicates that the development of a hypertrophied cranial crest evolved independently at least three times within the clade, suggesting that the crest enlargement is a recurring evolutionary trend within Lambeosaurinae.}},

The frontals and parietals are single in the adult and almost separated on the roof of the skull by the postfrontals. The temporal region shows a mosaic of primitive and derived character states. The quadrate was firmly held to the skull by a large squamosal and a small, free, quadratojugal was retained. However, reduction of the anterior process of the quadratojugal and of the posterior process of the jugal left the lower temporal fenestra broadly open. Comparison with other diapsids leads to the conclusion that Marmoretta was a lepidosauromorph, most probably the sister taxon of Lepidosauria.}},

  Abstract                 = {{It was traditionally thought that the oldest known dinosaur assemblages were not diverse, and that their early diversification and numerical dominance over other tetrapods occurred during the latest Triassic. However, new evidence gathered from the lower levels of the Ischigualasto Fm. of Argentina challenges this view. New dinosaur remains are described from this stratigraphical unit, including the new species <i>Chromogisaurus novasi</i>. This taxon is distinguished from other basal dinosauriforms by the presence of proximal caudals without median notch separating the postzygapophyses, femoral lateral surface with deep and large fossa immediately below the trochanteric shelf, and metatarsal II with strongly dorsoventrally asymmetric distal condyles. A phylogenetic analysis found <i>Chromogisaurus</i> to lie at the base of Sauropodomorpha, as a member of Guaibasauridae, an early branch of basal sauropodomorphs composed of <i>Guaibasaurus</i>, <i>Agnosphitys</i>, <i>Panphagia</i>, <i>Saturnalia</i> and <i>Chromogisaurus</i>. Such an affinity is for the first time suggested for <i>Guaibasaurus</i>, whereas <i>Panphagia</i> is not recovered as the most basal sauropodomorph. Furthermore, <i>Chromogisaurus</i> is consistently located as more closely related to <i>Saturnalia</i> than to any other dinosaur. Thus, the <i>Saturnalia</i> + <i>Chromogisaurus</i> clade is named here as the new subfamily Saturnaliinae. In addition, <i>Eoraptor</i> is found to be the sister-taxon of Neotheropoda, and herrerasaurids to be non-eusaurischian saurischians. The new evidence presented here demonstrates that dinosaurs first appeared in the fossil record as a diverse group, although they were a numerically minor component of faunas in which they occur. Accordingly, the early increase of dinosaur diversity and their numerical dominance over other terrestrial tetrapods were diachronous processes, with the latter preceded by a period of low abundance but high diversity.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Eucoelophysis baldwini Sullivan \& Lucas, 1999 is represented by several post- cranial elements from the Petrified Forest Formation (Norian), New Mexico, USA. Eucoelophysis Sullivan \& Lucas, 1999 was widely considered as a coelo- physoid dinosaur by several authors, but the hindlimb anatomy of this genus clearly indicates that it belongs to neither of these groups. The following fea- tures exclude Eucoelophysis from Neotheropoda: absence of oblique ligament groove on caudal surface of femoral head, femoral medial epicondyle small and smoothly rounded, absence of caudal cleft between medial part of the proximal end of the tibia and fibular condyles, cnemial crest low, and fibular crest absent. Moreover, Eucoelophysis lacks dinosaurian synapomorphic characters, but has a plesiomorphic slightly inturned femoral head that prevents its assignment to Dinosauria. Interestingly, the morphology of the femur of Eucoelophysis is extremely similar to that of the basal dinosauriform Silesaurus opolensis Dzik, 2003 from the Late Triassic of Poland. In order to determine the phylogenetic position of Eucoelophysis, a cladistic analysis was carried out, which depicts Eu- coelophysis as a non-dinosaurian dinosauriform. Thus reinterpreted, Eucoelophysis constitutes the youngest record of a non-dinosaurian dinosauriform, indicating their survival into the Norian, being co-eval with early dinosaurs.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Camposaurus arizonensis, a small theropod dinosaur from the early–middle Norian of Arizona (USA), is widely considered the oldest known neotheropod. However, despite its importance, Camposaurus is the subject of taxonomic and phylogenetic uncertainty and is often considered a nomen dubium, largely because of a fragmentary holotype. We here reassess the holotype of Camposaurus and identify two autapomorphies: the posterior edge of the tibial articular surface for the fibula offset as a sharp and prominent ridge and the absence of an anteriorly expanded medial condyle of the astragalus. We therefore consider Camposaurus to be a valid and diagnostic taxon of basal theropod dinosaur. For the first time, we include Camposaurus in a phylogenetic analysis, which confirms its neotheropod placement and recovers it as a close relative of Coelophysis rhodesiensis within Coelophysoidea sensu stricto. The position of Camposaurus as the oldest neotheropod provides an important calibration point, but necessitates long ghost lineages, indicating that our knowledge of the early evolutionary history of theropod dinosaurs is still patchy. Furthermore, our phylogenetic analysis recovers a polytomy at the base of Neotheropoda, as most parsimonious trees disagree in recovering a monophyletic or paraphyletic 'traditional' Coelophysoidea. This suggests that basal theropod phylogeny remains in a state of flux, and the monophyly of 'traditional' Coelophysoidea remains an open question.}},

This contribution reveals that common features that purportedly unite ?L.? airelensis with L. liliensterni are more widely distributed among coelophysoids and basal dinosaurs than it was thought. A cladistic analysis reveals that ?L.? airelensis is more closely related to the Coelophysidae than to L. liliensterni. A feature that supports this systematic arrangement includes a supraacetabular crest forming a well-developed ridge continuous with the lateral margin of the brevis fossa, with nondistinct notch between both structures. The new genus Lophostropheus, gen. nov., is therefore erected to include the species L. airelensis. Thus, the new combination Lophostropheus airelensis is proposed.}},

This taxon is represented by a nearly complete skull and fragmentary postcranial remains recovered from the Los Colorados Formation (Norian), NW Argentina. Originally, Zupaysaurus rougieri was considered a basal member of the Tetanurae, but its anatomy closely resembles that of the Coelophysoidea, supporting its nesting within this theropodan subclade. Thus reinterpreted, Zupaysaurus represents the first record of coelophysoids in South America. Phylogenetic analyses perfomed in this study depict Zupaysaurus as a non-coelophysid coelophysoid. Autopomorphic traits of Zupaysaurus include: maxillary-jugal ventral margin forming an obtuse angle in lateral view, tibia with a very deep and caudally open caudal fossa for the reception of an astragalar caudal process. Within the phylogenetic context outlined here, the derived features shared with Tetanurae (e.g. maxillary fenestra, caudally forked ascending ramus of the maxilla) are better interpreted as homoplasies rather than tetanuran derived features.}},

Specimen MPC-D 107/15 was collected from the upper beds of the Baruungoyot Formation (Campanian-Maastrichtian), and is a nest of eggs with the skeleton of the assumed parent of Nemegtomaia on top in brooding position. Much of the skeleton was damaged by colonies of dermestid coleopterans prior to its complete burial. However, diagnostic characters are recovered from the parts preserved, including the skull, partial forelimbs (including the left hand), legs, and distal portions of both feet. Nemegtomaia represents the fourth known genus of oviraptorid for which individuals have been found on nests of eggs. The second new specimen, MPC-D 107/16, was collected a few kilometers to the east in basal deposits of the Nemegt Formation, and includes both hands and femora of a smaller Nemegtomaia individual. The two formations and their diverse fossil assemblages have been considered to represent sequential time periods and different environments, but data presented here indicate partial overlap across the Baruungoyot-Nemegt transition. All other known oviraptorids from Mongolia and China are known exclusively from xeric or semi-arid environments. However, this study documents that Nemegtomaia is found in both arid/aeolian (Baruungoyot Formation) and more humid/fluvial (Nemegt Formation) facies.}},

  Abstract                 = {{In 1916, a centrosaurine dinosaur bonebed was excavated within the Campanian-aged deposits of what is now Dinosaur Provincial Park, Alberta, Canada. Specimens from this now-lost quarry, including two parietals, a squamosal, a skull missing the frill, and an incomplete dentary, were purchased by The Natural History Museum, London. The material was recently reprepared and identified herein as a previously unknown taxon, Spinops sternbergorum gen. et sp. nov. Based upon the available locality data and paleopalynology, the quarry lies in either the upper part of the Oldman Formation or the lower part of the Dinosaur Park Formation. The facial region of the partial skull is similar to putative mature specimens of Centrosaurus spp. and Styracosaurus albertensis, with short, rounded postorbital horncores and a large, erect nasal horncore. Parietal ornamentation is consistent on both known parietals and is unique among ceratopsids. Bilateral, procurved parietal hooks occupy the P1 (medial-most) position on the dorsal surface of the parietal and are very similar to those seen in Centrosaurus apertus. Epiparietals in the P2 or possibly P3 position (lateral to P1) manifest as extremely elongate, caudally directed spikes, unlike the condition in C. apertus, S. albertensis, or any other ?derived? centrosaurine. Cladistic analysis suggests that S. sternbergorum is closely related to Centrosaurus and Styracosaurus. Historically, based upon the condition in Styracosaurus and related centrosaurines, it was assumed that the medial-most elongated spikes on centrosaurine parietals correspond to the P3 epiparietal position. The exception illustrated in the new taxon suggests that homologies of epiparietals among basal centrosaurines (e.g., Albertaceratops and Diabloceratops) and derived centrosaurines (e.g., Styracosaurus and ?pachyrhinosaurs?) should be reconsidered. The medially-placed, caudally-directed ?P3? process of basal centrosaurines may, in fact, be homologous with P2.}},

A new theropod dinosaur, Dahalokely tokana, from Turonian-aged (\~{}90 million years old) strata of northernmost Madagascar is represented by a partial axial column. Autapomorphies include a prominently convex prezygoepipophyseal lamina on cervical vertebrae and a divided infraprezygapophyseal fossa through the mid-dorsal region, among others. Phylogenetic analysis definitively recovers the species as an abelisauroid theropod and weakly as a noasaurid. Dahalokely is the only known dinosaur from the interval during which Indo-Madagascar likely existed as a distinct landmass, but more complete material is needed to evaluate whether or not it is more closely related to later abelisauroids of Indo-Madagascar or those known elsewhere in Gondwana.}},

Cladistic affiliation is of considerable importance for this problematic taxon because all other members of the diverse Ceratopsidae are restricted to western North America. In a recent paper published in Naturwissenschaften, (Sues and Averianov 2009) described newly recovered specimens of Turanoceratops and conducted a cladistic analysis of Ceratopsia. Based on their study, the authors concluded that Turanoceratops is indeed a member of the less inclusive Ceratopsidae and, thus, represents ” the first definite ceratopsid dinosaur recorded from Asia.” This result has important implications for the biogeography, origin, and evolution of horned dinosaurs.The ingroup taxa used for ...}},

Nelson and Platnick (1981) instead wanted homology to exclude symplesiomorphies for reasons that they never made clear but which certainly included opposition to Hennig. They and some of their followers, most recently Platnick (2013) and Brower and de Pinna (2013), have continued to advocate that anti-Hennigian position, often under the slogan ” homology equals synapomorphy,” while ironically passing themselves off as cladists and often using ambiguous or falsified citations to pretend that legitimate phylogeneticists think likewise. Such authors have seldom shown much concern for accuracy or logic, with the result that a great deal of print has been wasted. Those problems can be avoided simply by maintaining a Hennigian view and so discarding the purported equivalence of homology and synapomorphy.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The recently-developed statistical method known as the "bootstrap" can be used to place confidence intervals on phylogenies. It involves resampling points from one's own data, with replacement, to create a series of bootstrap samples of the same size as the original data. Each of these is analyzed, and the variation among the resulting estimates taken to indicate the size of the error involved in making estimates from the original data. In the case of phylogenies, it is argued that the proper method of resampling is to keep all of the original species while sampling characters with replacement, under the assumption that the characters have been independently drawn by the systematist and have evolved independently. Majority-rule consensus trees can be used to construct a phylogeny showing all of the inferred monophyletic groups that occurred in a majority of the bootstrap samples. If a group shows up 95\% of the time or more, the evidence for it is taken to be statistically significant. Existing computer programs can be used to analyze different bootstrap samples by using weights on the characters, the weight of a character being how many times it was drawn in bootstrap sampling. When all characters are perfectly compatible, as envisioned by Hennig, bootstrap sampling becomes unnecessary; the bootstrap method would show significant evidence for a group if it is defined by three or more characters.}},

It is known from an incomplete but associated skeleton that includes cranial and post-cranial remains. Demandasaurus darwini gen. et sp. nov. presents 9 autapomorphies in the teeth and vertebrae. Demandasaurus is the first diplodocoid sauropod described from the Cretaceous of the Iberian Peninsula. Its inclusion in the Rebbachisauridae is well supported by our phylogenetic hypothesis, which situates it as a sister group of Nigersaurus from the Aptian of Niger, with which it shares various synapomorphies. The discovery of Demandasaurus provides further evidence of the sporadic use of the Apulian Route by dinosaurs during the Early Cretaceous for moving between the south of Europe (Laurasia) and the north of Africa (Gondwana).}},

P. perotorum shares characters with each of the previously known species that are not present in the other, including very large nasal and supraorbital bosses that are nearly in contact and separated only by a narrow groove as in P. canadensis, and a rostral comb formed by the nasals and premaxillae as in P. lakustai.

We describe the first post-Triassic ichthyosaur from the Middle East, Malawania anachronus gen. et sp. nov. from the Early Cretaceous of Iraq, and re-evaluate the evolutionary history of parvipelvian ichthyosaurs via phylogenetic and cladogenesis rate analyses. Malawania represents a basal grade in thunnosaurian evolution that arose during a major Late Triassic radiation event and was previously thought to have gone extinct during the Early Jurassic. Its pectoral morphology appears surprisingly archaic, retaining a forefin architecture similar to that of its Early Jurassic relatives. After the initial latest Triassic radiation of early thunnosaurians, two subsequent large radiations produced lineages with Cretaceous representatives, but the radiation events themselves are pre-Cretaceous. Cretaceous ichthyosaurs therefore include distantly related lineages, with contrasting evolutionary histories, and appear more diverse and disparate than previously supposed.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Ichthyosauria is a diverse clade of marine amniotes that spanned most of the Mesozoic. Until recently, most authors interpreted the fossil record as showing that three major extinction events affected this group during its history: one during the latest Triassic, one at the Jurassic\^{a}Cretaceous boundary (JCB), and one (resulting in total extinction) at the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary. The JCB was believed to eradicate most of the peculiar morphotypes found in the Late Jurassic, in favor of apparently less specialized forms in the Cretaceous. However, the record of ichthyosaurs from the Berriasian\^{a}Barremian interval is extremely limited, and the effects of the end-Jurassic extinction event on ichthyosaurs remains poorly understood. Based on new material from the Hauterivian of England and Germany and on abundant material from the Cambridge Greensand Formation, we name a new ophthalmosaurid, Acamptonectes densus gen. et sp. nov. This taxon shares numerous features with Ophthalmosaurus, a genus now restricted to the Callovian\^{a}Berriasian interval. Our phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ophthalmosauridae diverged early in its history into two markedly distinct clades, Ophthalmosaurinae and Platypterygiinae, both of which cross the JCB and persist to the late Albian at least. To evaluate the effect of the JCB extinction event on ichthyosaurs, we calculated cladogenesis, extinction, and survival rates for each stage of the Oxfordian\^{a}Barremian interval, under different scenarios. The extinction rate during the JCB never surpasses the background extinction rate for the Oxfordian\^{a}Barremian interval and the JCB records one of the highest survival rates of the interval. There is currently no evidence that ichthyosaurs were affected by the JCB extinction event, in contrast to many other marine groups. Ophthalmosaurid ichthyosaurs remained diverse from their rapid radiation in the Middle Jurassic to their total extinction at the beginning of the Late Cretaceous.}},

We conducted a new phylogenetic analysis of Thunnosauria, which supports a ?Stenopterygius? origin for Ophthalmosauridae. Sveltonectes is regarded as the sister taxon of Aegirosaurus, which shares a similar skull roof construction. Contrary to most other Cretaceous ichthyosaurs, Sveltonectes is characterized by delicate and sharply pointed teeth, confirming that the ophthalmosaurids were ecologically highly diversified during the Early Cretaceous.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The basal theropod dinosaur clade Ceratosauria, and its subclade Abelisauroidea, is characteristic of late Mesozoic terrestrial vertebrate faunas in western Gondwana (South America, Africa, Madagascar, and India) and Europe. Yet unambiguous records of ceratosaurs have hitherto been absent from Australia, where the theropod assemblage appears to include several typically Laurasian clades. Here, we report the first evidence of ceratosaurs (and potentially abelisauroids) from eastern Gondwana––a diagnostic astragalocalcaneum from the Aptian (121–125 Ma) of Victoria, Australia. Ceratosauria thus occurred in both western and eastern Gondwana during the Early Cretaceous. This fossil adds to the poorly known dinosaur fauna of Australia, a major clade of basal theropods, emphasising that its mid-Cretaceous theropod diversity was surprisingly cosmopolitan despite relative geographic isolation, including clades that have been thought to be typical of both Gondwana and Laurasia––Ceratosauria, Spinosauridae, Carcharodontosauria, Tyrannosauroidea, and Deinonychosauria. Such a contemporaneous association of theropod clades is unknown from other Gondwanan continents and questions the views that the late Mesozoic dinosaur fauna of Australia was dominated by Gondwanan or Laurasian elements, extreme isolation, relictualism, and/or novelty as a 'centre of origin'. The cosmopolitan theropod fauna of Australia probably reflects the global distribution of these clades early in their history, prior to significant continental breakup.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Latimeria is the product of a long coelacanth lineage, usually viewed as having changed very little. In this paper a classification of better known coelacanth genera is proposed based on a cladistic computer analysis of 56 morphological characters. Biometrical data are then matched with the classification to explore the possibility of identifying subtle change. It is concluded that throughout coelacanth history there have been changes in the structure of the vertebral column involving an overall increase in the number of vertebral elements, and a consequent crowding of these elements within the abdominal region. These changes may be associated with increasing lobation of the second dorsal and anal fins. In the skull, parameters involving the intracranial joint have also changed in such a way that the anterior part of the skull has lengthened in relation to the posterior part and this may be associated with an increase in length of the basicranial muscle.}},

The diagnostic features of C. mariscalensis include an extensive anteromedian projection of the nasal between the premaxillae, erect supraorbital horns, and laterally rounded squamosal. Nine cranial features that vary among Chasmosaurus species, Pentaceratops sternbergii, and other chasmosaurines are analyzed. Chasmosaurus mariscalensis appears to be most closely related to northern species of Chasmosaurus (C. belli, C. russelli), which also exhibit a transversely flattened nasal horn and modifications of the anterior margin of the external naris. The genus Chasmosaurus, in turn, appears to be most closely related to the other southern chasmosaurine, Pentaceratops sternbergii. The biogeographic history inferred from these relationships suggests that the biogeographic exchange between northern and southern chasmosaurines cannot be explained by a single dispersal event to the south.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The biotic recovery from Earth's most severe extinction event at the Permian-Triassic boundary largely reestablished the preextinction structure of marine trophic networks, with marine reptiles assuming the predator roles. However, the highest trophic level of today's marine ecosystems, i.e., macropredatory tetrapods that forage on prey of similar size to their own, was thus far lacking in the Paleozoic and early Mesozoic. Here we report a top-tier tetrapod predator, a very large (>8.6 m) ichthyosaur from the early Middle Triassic (244 Ma), of Nevada. This ichthyosaur had a massive skull and large labiolingually flattened teeth with two cutting edges indicative of a macropredatory feeding style. Its presence documents the rapid evolution of modern marine ecosystems in the Triassic where the same level of complexity as observed in today's marine ecosystems is reached within 8 My after the Permian-Triassic mass extinction and within 4 My of the time reptiles first invaded the sea. This find also indicates that the biotic recovery in the marine realm may have occurred faster compared with terrestrial ecosystems, where the first apex predators may not have evolved before the Carnian.}},

An elongate temporal region and an interorbital width exceeding that of the parietal table are both derived characters in sphenodontids. Polysphenodon is plesiomorphic for both conditions, whereas Brachyrhinodon displays the derived states. Therefore, it is assumed that the reduced snout has been independently derived in each genus. The limb elements of Polysphenodon are long relative to the size of the skull and are similar in proportions to some species of Homoeosaurus. This resemblance is considered to be indicative of similar locomotory requirements rather than close evolutionary relationships. Cladograms showing possible interrelationships within the Sphenodontida are based on twenty-nine character states.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Previously considered an actinopterygian or an osteichthyan incertae sedis, the Devonian (Givetian–Frasnian) Holopterygius nudus is reinterpreted as a coelacanth. This genus is among the oldest coelacanths known from articulated remains, but its eel-like morphology marks a considerable departure from the conventional coelacanth body plan. A cladistic analysis places Holopterygius as the sister taxon of the Carboniferous (Serpukhovian) genus Allenypterus. Despite the specialized morphology of these genera, they occupy a surprisingly basal position in coelacanth phylogeny; only Diplocercides and Miguashaia are further removed from the crown. A morphometric analysis reveals that coelacanths were anatomically disparate early in their history. Conflicts between this result and those of previous studies challenge the adequacy of systematic character sets for describing historical patterns of morphological variety. Coelacanths have long had an iconic place in the study of vertebrate evolution for their apparent anatomical conservatism over geological time, but Holopterygius provides clear evidence for rapid morphological evolution early in the history of this clade.}},

Burlington Barycrinus species include: B. rhombiferus (Owen and Shumard, 1852); B. magister (Hall, 1858); B. spurius (Hall, 1858); B. crassibrachiatus (Hall, 1860); B. scitulus (Meek and Worthen, 1860) n. combination; and B. sampsoni Miller and Gurley, 1896. Cyathocrinus latus Hall, 1861a, is here considered a junior synonym of B. rhombiferus. The stratigraphic practice of dividing the Burlington into upper and lower parts, for purposes of reporting species ranges, is evaluated. Morphologic data from these Burlington species are combined with data from late Osagean and Meramecian botryocrinid species of Barycrinus and Meniscocrinus, plus four species of Devonian and Mississippian Costalocrinus in a parsimony-based phylogenetic analysis of Mississippian botryocrinids. Results of this analysis indicate that 1) species of Barycrinus form a monophyletic clade that radiated rapidly during the Osagean; 2) B. rhombiferus may have been ancestral to all other Barycrinus species; and 3) M. magnitubus forms a clade with the Mississippian C. cornutus (Owen and Shumard, 1850) and the Devonian C. rex McIntosh, 1984.}},

The discovery of Bonitasaura salgadoi, a partial titanosaurian skeleton including cranial bones, permitted the definitive recognition of square jaws in a titanosaurian sauropod as well as a peculiar skull morphology that increases the morphological diversity of the group. Here we present a full description and illustration of the skull material of B. salgadoi. Among cranial bones, the lacrimal, quadrate, and dentary exhibit apomorphic differences from those of other titanosaurians. Conversely, the frontal and parietal are more conservative. A phylogenetic analysis recovers B. salgadoi as a member of the Titanosauria, related to mid-sized to large titanosauroids from the Turonian?Campanian of South America, in contrast to a previous hypothesis that suggested a nemegtosaurid affinity. The skull reconstruction presented here shows that the skull of B. salgadoi is anteroposteriorly short and dorsoventrally high, contrasting with the elongate skull of Rapetosaurus krausei.}},

A cladistic analysis of basal birds supports the placement of the new fossil as the sister-taxon of all pygostylians. Possessing a unique hand morphology with a phalangeal formula of 2-3-3-x-x and a reduced number of caudal vertebrae lacking a pygostyle, the new specimen reveals anatomical information previously unknown and increases the taxonomic diversity of primitive, non-pygostylian birds. We infer from the specimen that during the evolution of the avian tail, a decrease in relative caudal length and number of vertebrae preceded the distal fusion of caudals into a pygostyle.}},

New diagnostic features of Mei long are identified, including: a uniquely shaped maxilla, low with small, low maxillary fenestra; sacrum with an extremely wide caudal portion and elongate 4th and 5th sacral processes; and a large distal articular surface on the tibiotarsus which continues caudally on the tibia. A phylogenetic analysis including new data from the second specimen recovered Mei as a basal troodontid, in keeping with previous analyses. Although the skeleton exhibits several juvenile-like features including free cervical ribs, unfused frontals and nasals, and a short snouted skull, other attributes, full fusion of all neurocentral synostoses and the sacrum, and dense exteriors to cortical bone, suggest a small, mature individual. Microscopic examination of tibia and fibula histology confirms maturity and suggests an individual greater than two years old with slowed growth. Despite being one of the smallest dinosaurs, Mei long exhibits multi-year growth and cortical bone consisting largely of fibro-lamellar tissue marked by lines of arrested growth as in much larger and more basal theropods. This Mei long specimen lies in a similar but mirrored sleeping position to that of the holotype, strengthening the hypothesis that both specimens were preserved in a stereotypical life position. Like many Liaoning specimens, the new specimen also lacks extensive taphonomic and stratigraphic data, making further behavioral inference problematic.}},

  Abstract                 = {A review of lower actinopterygian phylogeny has led us to the conclusion that the Cladistia are the sister group of Recent actinopterygians (Actinopteri) and that the extinct Palaeonisciformes are a paraphyletic group, comprising stem-group actinopterygians (e.g. Cheirolepis), stem-group actinopterans (e.g. Moythomasia) and relatives of higher actinopterans such as Pteronisculus. Our analysis further concluded that the Acipenseriformes formed a clade together with Saurichthys and Birgeria, which was most parsimoniously resolved when the Acipenseriformes and Saurichthys were sister groups.  {\\\\\\\\copyright} 2005 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2005, 144, 5112212525.},

Most differences between the two type specimens are interpreted as related to ontogenetic growth: Morturneria is based on an immature, whereas Aristonectes is based on an adult, probably an old individual. Aristonectes exhibits an unique set of characters among Plesiosauria: a low and wide ogival skull, a paired vomeronasal fenestra, a mandible high anteriorly with a very short and high symphysis, a homodont dentition composed of numerous, strongly outwardly directed and poorly ornamented teeth (dental formula: 10?13 premaxillary, at least 51 maxillary and probably 60?65 dentary teeth, depending upon individual ontogeny). Moreover, Aristonectes shares several synapomorphies with the elasmosaurid clade, mainly strongly binocular-shaped and platycoelous cervical centra with lateral ridges. In contrast to cryptoclidids, it retains some plesiomorphic characters (e.g., horizontal jugal and poorly ventrally excavated cheek, glenoid fossa at about the same level as the alveolar row). The dental morphology and peculiar occlusal pattern, forming an interlocking trap, suggest that Aristonectes strained a diet of small, soft organisms from the water.}},

Lomasuchus is a ?mesosuchian? crocodile with a relatively narrow snout and serrated teeth, two large supraorbital bones fused over the orbit, and a deeply downturned lateral margin of the squamosal. The skull of Lomasuchus displays some apomorphic conditions as a wedge-like anterior process of the maxilla and a very short premaxillary contribution in the palate, which are only shared by Peirosaurus. The cladistic analysis performed shows the family Peirosauridae (Peirosaurus and Lomasuchus) as a natural group. A synopsis of all described species of Cretaceous crocodiles of South America is presented. Peirosaurids, sebecosuchians, Uruguaysuchus, and the eusuchian dolichochampsids are endemic of South America. Both notosuchids and Araripesuchus occur in Africa and South America and represent examples of vicariance. The monophyly of trematochampsids is weakly supported and their vicariant distribution is questionable. The Dyrosauridae and Pholidosauridae have a wider distribution, being present in South America and Africa and on the northern continents. Unlike in the northern continents, eusuchians played a minor role in the Late Cretaceous crocodilian assemblages of South America, where ?mesosuchians? were the principal components. This remarkable difference is another indication of the great influence that the geographic isolation of South America had on its terrestrial faunas during the Cretaceous.}},

Acristavus is a member of the newly erected clade Brachylophosaurini, which along with its other members, Brachylophosaurus and Maiasaura, constitutes the earliest hadrosaurine hadrosaurid clade. The new taxon occurred approximately 79 million years ago and has been recovered from the Two Medicine Formation of western Montana and nearly simultaneously in the Wahweap Formation of southern Utah. Corresponding with its age and relationship to the other members of the Brachylophosaurini, it is not surprising that Acristavus possesses traits seen in both Brachylophosaurus and Maiasaura, but not necessarily shared between them. One of the most interesting morphological features of Acristavus is the lack of cranial osteological ornamentation, which is in stark contrast to every other hadrosaurid dinosaur except Edmontosaurus. Combining stratigraphic and phylogenetic data from Acristavus yields support for the hypothesis that the hadrosaurid ancestor did not possess cranial ornamentation, and that the subfamilies Hadrosaurinae and Lambeosaurinae each independently developed display structures.}},

Gryposaurus monumentensis, sp. nov. is distinguished from other Gryposaurus species by possessing a more robust skull, enlarged clover-shaped prongs on the predentary oral margin, an anteroposteriorly narrow infratemporal fenestra, and other autapomorphies plausibly associated with feeding adaptations. The derived morphology revealed in G.\&\#8201;monumentensis necessitates revision of the generic diagnosis of Gryposaurus, including the addition of synapomorphies that further aid in distinguishing this taxon from Kritosaurus. A revised phylogenetic analysis places Gryposaurus within a monophyletic clade that includes Brachylophosaurus and Maiasaura. Gryposaurus monumentensis represents the most southern example of Gryposaurus, and underlines the remarkable diversification and long duration of this genus. Based on the phylogenetic, geographical, and stratigraphic evidence at hand, Gryposaurus was the most diverse genus within Hadrosaurinae; it also possessed one of the largest geographical and stratigraphic distributions, spanning more than five million years of the Campanian, and ranging from Alberta in the north to Utah (and possibly Texas) in the south.\&\#8195;\&\#169; 2007 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2007, 151, 351-376.}},

Although the holotype specimen is a juvenile individual?as evidenced by its incomplete crest development and relative size compared to other North American lambeosaurines?ontogeny independent autapomor-phies have been identified including quadrate with narrow quadratojugal notch and a postorbital with well developed, dorsally positioned squamosal process. Additionally, this taxon is unique in that the prefrontal is not dorsally deflected and anteroposteriorly expanded as in other lambeosaurine taxa of its size, but rather retains the frontal-prefrontal ?clamp? present in smaller individuals of other taxa. Phylogenetic analysis places Velafrons in a polytomy with numerous other fan-crested lambeosaurines. The crest structure of Velafrons more closely resembles that of Corythosaurus and Hypacrosaurus because it possesses an anteriorly projecting nasal process over the dorsal premaxilla process. Biogeo-graphically, Velafrons is one of three distinct hadrosaurids known from approximately 73.5 Ma?two lambeosaurines and one hadrosaurine?all restricted to the southern region of the Western Interior Basin of North America.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT A cladistic investigation of the phylogenetic relationships among 21 extinct and extant genera of sloths (Mammalia, Xenarthra, Tardigrada) was performed on the basis of characteristics of the bony anatomy of the auditory region. This study was undertaken in order to evaluate specific hypotheses of relationship within the group. Questions of particular interest include the relationship among the three traditional family groupings of extinct ground sloths and the monophyletic or diphyletic origin of the two genera of extant tree sloths. Eighty-five discrete morphological characters were analyzed using the computer program PAUP. Characters were polarized via comparisons to the following successive outgroups, all members of the supraordinal grouping Edentata: the Vermilingua, or anteaters; the Cingulata, or armadillos and glyptodonts; the Palaeanodonta; and the Pholidota, or pangolins. Three most parsimonious trees result (for 21 ingroup taxa and 5 outgroup taxa; Length = 304 steps, CI = 0.405, RI = 0.712). The results of this analysis provide characters which support the monophyly of the Xenarthra as a whole, as well as its dichotomous division into the clades Cingulata and Pilosa. In addition, it strongly corroborates the monophyly of the Vermilingua and the Tardigrada. Within tardigrades, the living three-toed sloth Bradypus is suggested to represent the sister-taxon to all other sloths. The results support the monophyly of the three traditional ground sloth families Megatheriidae, Megalonychidae, and Mylodontidae (the latter two quite strongly), and suggest that the subfamily Nothrotheriinae may represent a paraphyletic stem group for the remaining sloths. A novel relationship between the families Megalonychidae and Mylodontidae is proposed which contrasts with previous hypotheses of a close relationship between megalonychids and megatheriids. Lastly, this analysis strongly supports the derivation of the extant two-toed sloth Choloepus from within the West Indian megalonychid ground sloths, contradicting the traditional systematic grouping of the extant tree sloths into a monophyletic family Bradypodidae and suggesting that the living tree sloths represent one of the most remarkable examples of convergent evolution known among mammals.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract Parsimony-based analyses of a data set including 68 taxa coded for 186 morphological characters corroborate monophyly of Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates), Suiformes (hippos, pigs, peccaries), Neoselenodontia (camels, deer, cows), and Acreodi (whales, dolphins, porpoises, mesonychids). Additional findings include a sister-group relationship between Cainotheriidae and Cameloidea (Camelidae + Oromerycidae), Elomeryx as the sister group to all other suiform artiodactyls, Protoceratidae as the basal branch of Neoselenodontia, and paraphyly of Mesonychidae. The molecule-based groups Whippomorpha (whales, dolphins, hippos), Cetruminantia (whales, deer, cows), and Artiofabula (whales, cows, pigs) are contradicted by these data and occur together in trees that are at least 25 steps longer than the most parsimonious ones. In terms of tree length, the molecule-based topology is contradicted by morphological data with and without extinct taxa, and unlike previous, morphology-based analyses, the exclusion of Cetacea from the clade of living artiodactyls is not dependent on the inclusion of extinct taxa. Artiodactyla is diagnosed in all most parsimonious trees by several characters, including a short mastoid process of the petrosal, absence of an alisphenoid canal, and presence of an entocingulum on P4. Some previously suggested artiodactyl synapomorphies, such as an enlarged facial exposure of the lacrimal and absence of contact between the frontal and alisphenoid, are shown to be synapomorphies of more exclusive clades within Artiodactyla.}},

This new taxon is remarkable by the unusual shape of its hollow crest and by the important elongation of its neck and of its sacrum. An additional articulation between adjacent neural spines made the proximal third of the tail rigid, but it cannot be excluded that it is a pathological feature. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Olorotitan is the sister-taxon of the North American genera Corythosaurus and Hypacrosaurus. Lambeosaurines originated from Asia and then migrated to North America before or at the beginning of the Late Campanian. To cite this article: P. Godefroit et al., C. R. Palevol 2 (2003) 143–151.}},

This taxon is diagnosed by following autapomorphies: large helmet-like hollow crest higher than the rest of the skull and extending caudally well beyond the level of the occiput; very high postorbital process of jugal (ratio height of postorbital process/length of jugal = 1); rostral portion of the jugal shorter than in other lambeosaurines, with a perfectly straight rostral margin; very asymmetrical maxilla in lateral view, with ventral margin distinctly downturned; very elongated neck composed of 18 cervical vertebrae; tibia as high as the femur; shorter cnemial crest, about one fifth of tibia length. A phylogenetic analysis, based on 118 cranial, dental, and postcranial characters, indicates that Olorotitan is a member of the Corythosaurini clade, and is the sister taxon of Corythosaurus casuarius, Hypacrosaurus stebingeri, and Hypacrosaurus altispinus. The high diversity and mosaic distribution of Maastrichtian hadrosaurid faunas in the Amur-Heilongjiang region are the result of a complex palaeogeographical history and imply that many independent hadrosaurid lineages dispersed readily between western America and eastern Asia at the end of the Cretaceous.}},

More than 90\% of the bones discovered in these localities belong to hollow-crested lambeosaurine saurolophids, but flat-headed saurolophines are also represented: Kerberosaurus manakini at Blagoveschensk and Wulagasaurus dongi at Wulaga. Herein we describe a new saurolophine dinosaur, Kundurosaurus nagornyi gen. et sp. nov., from the Udurchukan Formation (Maastrichtian) of Kundur, represented by disarticulated cranial and postcranial material. This new taxon is diagnosed by four autapomorphies. A phylogenetic analysis of saurolophines indicates that Kundurosaurus nagornyi is nested within a rather robust clade including Edmontosaurus spp., Saurolophus spp., and Prosaurolophus maximus, possibly as a sister-taxon for Kerberosaurus manakini also from the Udurchukan Formation of Far Eastern Russia.

  Abstract                 = {{Several hundred disarticulated dinosaur bones have been recovered from a large quarry at Wulaga (Heilongjiang Province, China), in the Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) Yuliangze Formation. The Wulaga quarry can be regarded as a monodominant bonebed: more than 80\% of the bones belong to a new lambeosaurine hadrosaurid, Sahaliyania elunchunorum gen. et sp. nov. This taxon is characterised by long and slender paroccipital processes, a prominent lateral depression on the dorsal surface of the frontal, a quadratojugal notch that is displaced ventrally on the quadrate, and a prepubic blade that is asymmetrically expanded, with an important emphasis to the dorsal side. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Sahaliyania is a derived lambeosaurine that forms a monophyletic group with the corythosaur and parasauroloph clades. Nevertheless, the exact position of Sahaliyania within this clade cannot be resolved on the basis of the available material. Besides Sahaliyania, other isolated bones display a typical hadrosaurine morphology and are referred to Wulagasaurus dongi gen. et sp. nov., a new taxon characterised by the maxilla pierced by a single foramen below the jugal process, a very slender dentary not pierced by foramina, and by the deltopectoral crest (on the humerus) oriented cranially. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Wulagasaurus is the most basal hadrosaurine known to date. Phylogeographic data suggests that the hadrosaurines, and thus all hadrosaurids, are of Asian origin, which implies a relatively long ghost lineage of approximately 13 million years for basal hadrosaurines in Asia.}},

Here we describe a small new theropod dinosaur from the Late Jurassic period of Schamhaupten in southern Germany3, 4. Being exquisitely preserved and complete from the snout to the distal third of the tail, the new fossil is the best-preserved predatory, non-avian dinosaur in Europe. It possesses a suite of characters that support its identification as a basal coelurosaur. A cladistic analysis indicates that the new taxon is closer to maniraptorans than to tyrannosauroids, grouping it with taxa often considered to be compsognathids. Large portions of integument are preserved along its tail. The absence of feathers or feather-like structures in a fossil phylogenetically nested within feathered theropods5, 6 indicates that the evolution of these integumentary structures might be more complex than previously thought.}},

When all the possible dichotomous trees have the same length, no one tree is better supported than the others, and the data are completely undecisive. From a rule for recursively generating undecisive matrices for different numbers of taxa, formulas to calculate consistency, rescaled consistency and retention indices in undecisive matrices are derived. The least decisive matrices are not the matrices with the lowest possible consistency, rescaled consistency or retention indices (on the most parsimonious trees); those statistics do not directly vary with decisiveness. Decisiveness can be measured with a newly proposed statistic, DD=S̄−S)/(S̄−S) (where S= length of the most parsimonious cladogram, S̄= mean length of all the possible cladograms for the data set and M= observed variation). For any data set, S̄ can be calculated exactly with simple formulas; it depends on the types of characters present, and not on their congruence. Despite some recent assertions to the contrary, the consistency index is an appropriate measure of homoplasy (= deviation from hierarchy). The retention index seems more appropriate for comparing the fit of different trees for the same data set.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract Several aspects of current resampling methods to assess group support are reviewed. When the characters have different prior weights or some state transformation costs are different, the frequencies under either bootstrapping or jackknifing can be distorted, producing either under- or overestimations of the actual group support. This is avoided by symmetric resampling, where the probability p of increasing the weight of a character equals the probability of decreasing it. Problems with interpreting absolute group frequencies as a measure of the support are discussed; group support does not necessarily vary with the frequency itself, since in some cases groups with positive support may have much lower frequencies than groups with no support at all. Three possible solutions for this problem are suggested. The first is measuring the support as the difference in frequency between the group and its most frequent contradictory group. The second is calculating frequencies for values of p below the threshold under which the frequency ranks the groups in the right order of support (this threshold may vary from data set to data set). The third is estimating the support by using the slope of the frequency as a function of different (low) values of p; when p is low, groups with actual support have negative slopes (closer to 0 when the support is higher), and groups with no support have positive slopes (larger when evidence for and against the group is more abundant).}},

It shares with Notosuchus of South America the following derived features: jaw articulation that permitted longitudinal movement and the occipital condyle on the ventral surface of the braincase. The Malawi crocodyliform is distinct from Notosuchus in possessing multicusped posterior teeth, narrow and elongate prefrontals, no maxillo-palatal fenestrae, deeply overhung squamosal, and a longer, flat jaw articulation surface. The long, flat jaw articulation and tooth morphology suggest proal processing of food. The Malawi crocodyliform has cervical vertebrae with well developed hypapophyses and tall neural spines indicating strong neck muscles. The femur has a well developed medially directed head and posteriorly directed distal condyles. The crus projects from the tarsals vertically. These features suggest an erect posture and cursorial ability. The supracondylar ridges of the humerus are well developed for muscle attachment indicating strong rotation and retraction of the humerus. Articulated specimens suggest preservation in burrows.}},

The specimen comes from Upper Cretaceous strata assigned to the Portezuelo Formation (upper Turonian-lower Coniacian). It includes proximal, middle and distal caudal vertebrae, chevrons, dorsal ribs, and appendicular bones. Malarguesaurus is characterized by the following association of characters: (1) proximal caudal neural spines vertically directed, with a concave caudal border, and a caudodorsal corner forming a right angle; (2) procoelous-opisthoplatyan proximal and middle caudal vertebrae associated with procoelous distal caudal centra; and (3) distal caudal neural spines having a concave and depressed dorsal border. A preliminar cladistic analysis placed ( Ligabuesaurus  + ( Malarguesaurus  +  Phuwiangosaurus )) as a sister taxon of Titanosauria. Unique among the titanosauriforms, Malarguesaurus has procoelous distal caudal centra associated with procoelous-opisthoplatyan proximal caudals. This discovery is a new evidence of the morphologic diversity of the South American sauropods.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT The comparative osteology, phylogenetic relationships, and historical biogeography of all known taxa of fossil and living amiid fishes (Halecomorphi: Amiidae) are investigated in detail. Previously, the detailed osteology of nearly all fossil amiids was unknown. We present the first well-supported comprehensive phylogeny for fossil and living amiid fishes. We synthesize clearly documented phylogenetic data on amiids and other halecomorph fishes with other historical phenomena such as ontogeny, historical biogeography, stratigraphic paleontology, and paleoecology (both ?stationary? and ?historical?). We also use our study of halecomorph fishes as a platform to explore several fundamental methodological and theoretical concepts important to phylogenetic/evolutionary investigations. These concepts pertain mainly to (1) the use of comparative empirical data to interpret various historical patterns and (2) the practice of integrating fossil and living species together in original (i.e., non-literature-based) phylogenetic studies. As proposed by Patterson (1973), Amia calva is the sole surviving member of a formerly diverse clade, Halecomorphi. Even Amiidae (the halecomorph subgroup that is the focus of this study) was taxonomically diverse and widespread during Mesozoic and Paleogene times. Amiidae here includes only those amiiform fishes that have solid perichordally ossified diplospondylous centra of both the ?normal? (a term used here for non-alternating) and the alternating type in the caudal region. Consequently, ?Sinamiidae and ?Caturoidea (?Caturidae plus ?Liodesmidae) are excluded from the family Amiidae. To set the style and terminology for description of the fossil taxa, and to present a fresh look at the osteology and development of the only living amiiform, we redescribe Amia calva in detail using modern methods of preparation and illustration. Detailed study of Amia calva is critical for interpreting probable intraspecific variation and ontogeny in fossil skeletons. We examined individual variation of both bone morphology and developmental timing in Amia calva. We classify the family Amiidae into four subfamilies here: ?Amiinae (including ?Amia, ?Cyclurus, ?Pseudamiatus, and ? ?Amia? hesperia), ?Vidalamiinae subfam. nov. (including ? Vidalamia, ?Pachyamia, ?Melvius, ?Calamopleurus, and ?Maliamia), ?Solnhofenamiinae subfam. nov. (including ?Solnhofenamia gen. nov.), and ?Amiopsinae subfam. nov. (including ?Amiopsis). The genus ?Nipponamia remains Amiidae subfamily indeterminate until additional material can be found and studied, although it does not appear to belong to Amiinae or ?Amiopsinae subfam. nov. as defined here. Other nominal genera of Amiidae are discussed as nomina nuda or nomina dubia. We found Amiinae to be a clearly monophyletic group diagnosed by numerous synapomorphic characters. This is the only amiid (and halecomorph) subfamily known to have survived beyond the early Eoccne. It was a diverse group with a known stratigraphic range of Late Cretaceous through the present. The earliest diagnosable species in the subfamily is ?Cyclurus fragosus from the upper Maastrichtian of Alberta, Canada, and the earliest Amiinae indeterminate is a collection of fragments from the upper Cenomanian of Uzbekhistan (??Amia semimarina? Nessov 1985, a nomen dubium). Earlier forms reported by Boreske (1974) could not be verified as Amiinae. Amiinae was widespread and particularly speciose during the Eocene, and appears to have been confined almost exclusively to fresh water. The extremely rare amiine fossil fragments from brackish water deposits probably represent accidental or, at most, occasional migration into brackish environments or possibly entrapment in a drying water system. Amiinae includes three valid species of Amia (including ?A. pattersoni sp. nov.), eight valid species of ?Cyclurus (all of which are described here), and ? ?Amia? hesperia (a valid species of uncertain generic affinity). It also includes the genus ?Pseudamiatus which remains ?Amiinae indeterminate, until the type and only known specimen can be further prepared or until additional material can be found. It probably belongs in Amia or ?Cyclurus as those genera are defined here. We also review more than 30 other nominal species of amiines, all of which we believe are invalid names (either nomina dubia, nominanuda, or subjective junior synonyms) but some of which nevertheless extend the stratigraphic and geographic range of the subfamily Amiinae. Although we clarify the known diversity and monophyly of Amiinae, and add new morphological information about numerous amiine species, further materials and work are needed to resolve phylogenetic interrelationships within this subfamily. ?Vidalamiinae subfam. nov. is a previously unrecognized, diverse group of amiid taxa, several of which reach very large sizes (to about two meters total length). This well-supported monophyletic subfamily is known only from the Early Cretaceous to the early Eocene, and contains two well-supported monophyletic subgroups: ?Vidalamiini tribe nov. and ?Calamopleurini tribe nov. These tribes have interesting biogeographic distributions that seem incongruent with today's geography, but these distributions make intuitive sense given current interpretations of the paleogeography of the Early Cretaceous (illustrated here). ?Vidalamiini tribe nov. includes ?Vidalamia (one species from coastal estuarine/lagoonal deposits of Spain), ?Pachyamia (two species: one from marine deposits of the Middle East and a new species from marine deposits in Mexico) and ?Melvius (two species from deposits along the margin of the Upper Cretaceous North American Seaway). During the Early Cretaceous, this seemingly far-flung distribution was connected by a continuous shallow marine continental margin and seaway. All five species of ?Vidalamiini tribe nov. are described in detail here. ?Calamopleurini tribe nov. includes ?Calamopleurus (three species: one from an inconclusively determined paleoenvironment of eastern Brazil, one species from a probable freshwater paleoenvironment of eastern Brazil, and a new species from a yet unknown paleoenvironment of Morocco) and ?Maliamia (one species from west-central Africa in deposits of unknown water chemistry). Most of these species (particularly ?C. cylindricus) are described in detail here. ?Vidalamiinae subfam. nov. is the sister group to Amiinae, and the two subfamilies together form the supersubfamily Amiista nuper interposita. The term ?nuper interposita? is introduced here to indicate the first published use of new names inserted between existing family group names. ?Solnhofenamiinae subfam. nov. is a Late Jurassic marine group from Europe (Germany and France) currently containing a single species, ?Solnhofenamia elongata gen. nov. This species was formerly placed in the genus ? Urocles as ? ?Urocles? elongatus. However, the genus ? Urocles is invalid in our scheme because the type species of ?Urocles is congeneric with ?Amiopsis, and the name ?Amiopsis has priority. We find that ? ?Urocles? elongatus is more closely related to a group containing Amiinae plus ?Vidalamiinae subfam. nov., than it is to the type species of the genus ?Urocles (= ?Amiopsis lepidota here). Therefore, we place ??Urocles? elongatus in the new genus ?Solnhofenamia. Because ?S. elongata gen. nov. is the sister group to a group containing Amiinae plus ?Vidalamiinae subfam. nov., we put it into ?Solnhofenamiinae subfam. nov. We describe this species in detail for the first time. ?Amiopsinae subfam. nov. is a poorly supported stem group of amiids from Late Jurassic to late Cretaceous (Turonian) marine and freshwater deposits of Europe (Yugoslavia, Germany, Spain, England, Belgium, and possibly France). This group, with five valid species, may be non-monophyletic. ?Amiopsinae subfam. nov. contains most of the amiids excluded from the hypersubfamily Amiida nuper interposita, a monophyletic group containing ((Amiinae + ?Vidalamiinae subfam. nov.) + ?Solnhofenamiinae subfam. nov.). All five species of ?Amiopsis are described here with much new detail. The phylogenetic position and biogeographic significance of the single known, poorly preserved specimen of ?Nipponamia, from Early Cretaceous freshwater deposits of Japan, is largely unknown. Additional material is needed to better understand its morphology. In addition to our cladogram of Amiidae, we produced a cladogram of Halecomorphi. Our sample of non-amiid halecomorph taxa was far less complete than our sample of amiid taxa; nevertheless we found several well-supported nodes within non-amiid halecomorphs which can serve as general guides for future research. We discuss numerous general methodological, philosophical, and theoretical concepts in this paper, including the construction of taxonomic diagnoses, the treatment of undiagnosable taxa, and the treatment of ontogenetically variable characters. We review the effects on phylogenetic analysis of problematic (e.g., ?missing?) data entries resulting from either problematic taxa (e.g., highly incomplete fossil taxa) or problematic characters (characters whose states are unknown for most taxa). Various types of problematic data are also reviewed. We discuss the exclusion of certain problematic taxa (here termed ?inserted? taxa) and problematic characters (here termed ?mapped? characters) from phylogenetic analyses. We also examine the effects of phylogenetically ?redundant? taxa and consider the comparative value of wellresolved nodes versus completely resolved trees in cladistic studies. These concepts and terms can all be located in this volume by using the table of contents or the subject index. Our study exemplifies the large amount of natural historical information that can be interpreted from multidisciplinary pattern studies of fossil and living actinopterygian fishes. We term our general approach to the study of natural history as ?an empirical synthetic pattern approach?, an exploratory method whose fundamentals go back to the 19th century naturalist Louis Agassiz (1807?1873). Many other actinopterygian groups of equal potential remain virtually unstudied with regard to their broad historical significance (e.g., phylogenetic pattern congruence between comparative morphology, ontogeny, biogeography, and stratigraphy). Exceptional preservation and abundant poorly known material make fossil actinopterygians one of the greatest remaining frontiers in vertebrate paleontology.}},

  Abstract                 = {{This paper represents the first cladistic analysis of the interrelationships of all nominal fossil and living gonorynchiform genera. Gonorynchiformes is the basal group of the superorder Ostariophysi, and is confirmed as monophyletic on the basis of 12 synapomorphies. The Gonorynchiformes is be subdivided into two monophyletic suborders, Chanoidei and Gonorynchoidei. The Chanoidei includes the family Chanidae, which in turn includes the Recent Chanos plus five fossil genera, grouped in two subfamilies: Chaninae ((Chanos+2020 Tharrhiai) +2020Parachanos+2020Dastilbe) and 2020Rubiesichthyinae (2020Rubiesichthys+2020Gordichthys). 2020Aethalionopsis is the sister-group to the Chanidae. Gonorynchoidei includes two families Gonorynchidae and Kneriidae. Gonorynchidae is formed by (Gonorynchus,2020Notogoneus) and four fossil taxa of uncertain definition and interrelationships: 2020Charitosomus,2020Charitopsis,2020Ramallichthys, and 2020fudeichthys. The last four genera were previously included in the families 2020Charitosomidae and 2020Judeichthyidae, which could not be supported as monophyletic in this analysis. Kneriidae consists of two subfamilies Phractolaeminae with one genus Phractolaemus, and Kneriinae which includes ((Kneria + Parakneria) + (Grasseichthys + Cromeria)), the latter two being paedomorphic forms. The Phractolaeminae and the Kneriinae are freshwater African taxa with no known fossil record. The order Gonorynchiformes is represented herein by 18 genera, extending back to the Early Cretaceous. More work is required to clarify the interrelationships of the Gonorynchidae and the paedomorphic characters that apparently played an important role in the evolution of this morphologically diverse group of fishes.}},

  Abstract                 = {{A unique find of a partial egg in contact with articulated gastralia from a known specimen of the dromaeosaurid Deinonychus antirrhopus (AMNH 3015) is described. Much of the original taphonomic context of the specimen was lost during the 1931 excavation and preparation, but enough information is preserved to provide strong evidence for a parental association between the adult skeleton and egg. The articulated nature of the gastralia suggests that the adult skeleton was at least partially articulated and had not suffered from either extensive subaerial exposure or postmortem transport, and the egg preservation also indicates in situ burial and postburial lithogenic crushing. Additional support stems from the presence of limey claystone matrix that indicates a low-energy depositional event. Phylogenetic characteristics of the eggshell microstructure are consistent with a theropod origin, and skeletochronological analysis suggests that AMNH 3015 was an adult and thus of breeding age bolstering the interpretation that the egg derives from the skeletal specimen. Physiological parameters of D. antirrhopus, such as estimated mass and pelvic canal diameter, as well as eggshell thickness, are very similar to the similar sized and closely related oviraptorid Citipati osmolskae. Closely related maniraptoran theropods of several species have been found brooding their nests with the gastralia close to or in contact with eggs, and such a scenario is consistent with the preservation of AMNH 3015. Alternative explanations to a parental association, such as random co-occurrence or feeding, are improbable given the taphonomic and biological data of the find. AMNH 3015, therefore, probably represents the first identifiable dromaeosaurid egg yet discovered. It shares derived characters such as two eggshell layers with other theropods. Within theropods, the AMNH 3015 eggshell shares derived characteristics with oviraptorids and differs from troodontid eggshell despite the fact that these taxa are often recovered as sister groups in analyses of skeletal characters, but this signal is weak.}},

The morphology of two new taxa of Iniopterygidae, Rainerichthys zangerli and Papilionichthys stahlae, from the Upper Mississippian of Montana is now described. They exhibit the iniopterygian synapomorphy of dorsolaterally placed pectoral fins. They also display a laterally compressed head and body, a homocercal tail, and a single aspinous dorsal fin originating at approximately mid-body. These taxa differ in upper dental elements, bony cranial plates, body squamation, buccopharyngeal denticles, cranial linking cartilages, palatoquadrate shape, pterygoid articulation, pectoral axis and pectoral girdle shape, and in the robustness of branchial and suprascapular cartilages. The neurocranium is unique among known chondrichthyans in presenting anterior ethmosphenoid and posterior otico-occipital units separated by an intracranial joint. A complete otico-occipital fissure is found posteriorly. One to two pairs of upper parasymphysial whorls and one median lower premandibular symphysial whorl are present. Symphysial whorls were mobile and the cranial complex appears to have been kinetic. Cladistic assessment places these new taxa as basal chondrichthyans below the divergence of the Elasmobranchii and the Euchondrocephali. The range of morphology within known iniopterygians supports rapid diversification and niche specialization in this group of atypical chondrichthyans.}},

This discovery suggests the occurrence of Heterotidinae in the Paleocene of western North America. The inclusion of ?Joffrichthys gen. nov. in the Heterotidinae is supported by at least four synapomorphies: maxilla posteriorly lying on dentary part of lower jaw, horizontal arm of preopercle about as long as vertical arm, a large, irregularly wide, and trapezoidal io2, and approximately equal-sized dorsal and anal fins. The presumed ?Sinoglossus-Scleropages-Osteoglossum relationship is not supported. This paper recognizes a Heterotidinae relationship of ?Sinoglossus based on shared derived character states. Three features (io1 fused with antorbital, a typical ?cheek wall? formed by io1 to io3 and covering all the area below the orbit from the antorbital to the anterior edge of the preopercle, and reticulate scales) even suggest that the eastern Asian Eocene-Oligocene ?Sinoglossus is probably sister to the clade consisting of Heterotis and Arapaima. Two Late Jurassic and/or Early Cretaceous eastern Asian teleosts (?Huashia and ?Kuntulunia) and one mid-Cretaceous South American primitive osteoglossomorph (?Laeliichthys) might have some relationship with the ancestral lineages of Heterotidinae. However, evidence remains inconclusive about the early evolution of Heterotidinae.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Phylogenetic relationships within the neogastropod family Nassariidae are poorly understood as are relationships between the Nassariidae and other fossil and extant buccinid taxa. The poor resolution of nassariid and buccinoidean relationships is due to: 1) the complex distribution among these gastropods of characters commonly used in classification; 2) a number of Mesozoic and Paleogene genera whose relationships to extant buccinoidean lineages are poorly constrained; and 3) a lack of previous efforts to address these problems on a rigorous, phylogenetic basis. The results of a phylogenetic analysis of nassariid genera did not decisively support the monophyly of the family. The buccinid subfamily Photinae was an extant sister group to the Nassariinae in a phylogenetic analysis of extant taxa and on many cladograms from an analysis combining fossil and extant taxa. In addition, Buccitriton (representing the Paleogene Tritiaria group) was a sister taxon to the Nassariinae in all analyses in which it was included, regardless of the identity of the extant nassariine sister group. This suggests that the photines, which likely arose from a Tritiaria ancestor, are the closest living relatives to the Nassariinae. Many Paleogene fossil "buccinoid" taxa appear to be more distantly related to the Nassariinae and possibly to the rest of the nassariids as well. Stratigraphic range data combined with the results of this study suggest that the Nassariinae diversified rapidly in the early Miocene and achieved a cosmopolitan distribution early in their history. A largely Indo-Pacific subclade was consistently deeply-nested within the Nassariinae, suggesting that nassariines invaded the Indo-Pacific region most recently. The timing of this invasion is difficult to estimate but had occurred by the end of the Miocene. Further analyses using molecular sequence data, relative stratigraphic position, or focusing in more detail on the Paleogene taxa are required to resolve the identity of the sister group to the Nassariinae with greater confidence. 10.1666/0022-3360(2000)074<0839:PRANG>2.0.CO;2}},

Represented by a nearly complete left wing and shoulder girdle the size of a rock dove, the new bird was quarried from laminated yellowish mudstones of the Xiagou Formation (Xinminpu Group) near Changma, in the Jiuquan area. These deposits have previously yielded the only known specimen of Gansus yumenensis, a basal ornithuromorph represented by the distal half of a hind limb with long and slender digits. Several derived characters of the new occurrence supports its allocation within Enantiornithes: (1) a convex lateral margin of the coracoid, (2) a minor metacarpal that projects distally more than the major metacarpal and (3) a proximal phalanx of the major digit longer than the intermediate (second) phalanx. The general proportions of the wing suggest it was a flier comparable to most other known enantiornithine birds. Although, direct comparisons between the new fossil and Gansus are not possible, phylogenetic based inferences supports their placement into two different clades. While the new fossil falls definitively within the enantiornithines, G. Yumenensis falls within the ornithuromorphs. The new occurrence thus adds to the taxonomic diversity of Early Cretaceous birds from Gansu Province in particular and central Asia in general.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Jeholosaurus shangyuanensis is a small ornithischian dinosaur from the Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation of the Lujiatun locality, Liaoning Province, China. Here, we provide the first detailed description of its postcranial skeleton based on the holotype and four other well-preserved skeletons, and compare it with material of other primitive cerapodans. Jeholosaurus can be diagnosed on the basis of one postcranial autapomorphy, relating to the absence of parapophyses from the anterior dorsal vertebrae, and a unique combination of postcranial characters, but its anatomy is otherwise similar to that of many other basal ornithischians. A phylogenetic analysis incorporating these new postcranial data confirms previous suggestions that Jeholosaurus is a basal ornithopod and that it forms a clade with Changchunsaurus and Haya; Koreanosaurus and Yueosaurus might also belong to this clade, though additional material of both will be required to test this hypothesis. The name Jeholosauridae is proposed for this apparently endemic group of Cretaceous East Asian taxa.}},

It retains sauropod symplesiomorphies that are unexpected in a Late Jurassic taxon and thus sheds light on the evolutionary origins of the Flagellicaudata. Despite being comparatively small, the holotype of Suuwassea demonstrates hallmarks of relatively advanced age. A phylogenetic analysis of 30 taxa and 331 characters retains Suuwassea in a trichotomy with the Diplodocidae (Apatosaurus + (Diplodocus + Barosaurus)) and the Dicraeosauridae (Dicraeosaurus + Amargasaurus). This lack of resolution is probably due to a combination of missing data, character conflict and poor incorporation of specimens referred to diplodocid taxa that differ from their holotype specimens and species holotypes. Middle Jurassic palaeobiogeographical reconstructions conflict with the hypothetical distribution of flagellicaudatans in the Middle and Late Jurassic based on their phylogeny, implying that physical barriers, such as epeiric seas, were not responsible for limiting their initial radiation. The postparietal foramen shared by Suuwassea, Dicraeosaurus, Tornieria and Amargasaurus may correlate to preferred existence in near-shore, terrestrial environments.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Despite the fact that fossil crocodylians have been recovered from the Panama Canal Zone starting with initial excavations in 1912, detailed studies have been lacking. Recent excavations of the canal have resulted in new discoveries of many vertebrate fossils, including the first known Miocene crocodylian skulls from Central America. These fossil skulls from the early?middle Miocene represent two new taxa with distinct morphology that is shared with extinct and extant caimans (Caimaninae). A cladistic analysis of 32 alligatorid and three outgroup taxa, scored for 75 characters, resulted in 1210 equally most parsimonious cladograms, all of which suggest that Culebrasuchus mesoamericanus, gen. et sp. nov., is the sister taxon to all previously known Caimaninae. Additionally, the analysis suggests that Centenariosuchus gilmorei, gen. et sp. nov., is the sister taxon to a caimanine clade that includes Purussaurus from the Miocene of South America. In fact, teeth very similar to those of Purussaurus have also been recovered from the Panama Canal. Given these South American affinities, we suggest that these early caimanines dispersed across saltwater. This is a potentially surprising result, because all extant alligatorids lack the salt glands that would have been necessary for the marine dispersal required to reach Central America during the Miocene. Unlike Miocene mammals that all have North American affinities, the Miocene crocodylians of Panama represent a ?melting pot? with taxa of disparate origins living together at the southern extreme of Central America.

The possession of the fewest synapomorphies among hadrosaurids places Protohadros at the basal position within Hadrosauridae. The combination of a derived maxillopalatal unit and a primitive quadrate indicate a level of cranial kinesis intermediate between primitive iguanodontians and other hadrosaurids. Both the phylogenetic and chronological distributions of these characteristics describe an evolutionary sequence of adaptations in which modifications for increased masticatory ability of the maxillary region precede the evolution of both streptostylic cranial kinesis and a more derived mandible in Hadrosauridae. The taxon is unique among hadrosaurids in possessing a ventrally deflected muzzle, including a deep, rostrally massive mandible, that is interpreted to represent an exclusively low-browsing pattern of food acquisition in a deltaic environment. At 95 Ma, Protohadros is the oldest definitive hadrosaurid. This plus the phylogenetic and biogeographic position of the specimen indicate that a North American origin of Hadrosauridae is equally as likely as the prevalent Asian origin hypothesis.}},

These assemblages are also remarkable by their quality of preservation and are represented by ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, turtles and crocodyliforms. Despite the abundant crocodyliform record, only two metriorhynchid taxa have been identified: Cricosaurus araucanensis and Dakosaurus andiniensis. Here we described a new species of Cricosaurus, which represents the second species of Cricosaurus in the Tithonian of the Neuqu\'{e}n Basin, and the first metriorhynchid found in lithographic limestone from Gondwana. Furthermore, this specimen has the most complete postcranial remains of any metriorhynchid from South America. The new species is characterized by a short distance between the premaxilla and the nasal, a relatively narrow interorbital width, 23–25 mandibular teeth, bicarinated teeth with fine apicobasally aligned ridges, interalveolar spaces between the first seven teeth approximately 1.5 times longer than the anteroposterior diameter of the respective alveoli. To test the assignment of the new species to Cricosaurus, we carried out two phylogenetic analyses. In both analyses, Cricosaurus lithographicus sp. nov. is nested with other species referred to this genus. This new species has peculiar enamel ornamentation, characterized by numerous, fine apicobasally aligned ridges, when compared to other species of the genus.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract Here we report the occurrence of a juvenile ankylosaur from the Upper Cretaceous locality Ukhaa Tolgod in southern Mongolia. The locality is well known for its exquisitely preserved theropods, mammals, and squamates, but until now has not yielded diagnostic ankylosaur material, although ankylosaur specimens are common at the site. The new specimen consists of a nearly complete skull with associated mandible and osteoderms that exhibits the following ankylosaurid synapomorphies: two pairs of osteodermal ?horns? projecting from the quadratojugals and squamosals; a wide, triangular skull; a premaxillary beak edge that is not continuous with the maxillary tooth row; and absence of premaxillary teeth. We refer the specimen to Pinacosaurus grangeri based on the presence of a large premaxillary sinus, a quadrate not co-ossified with the paroccipital process, and several pairs of accessory openings in the narial region. The new specimen differs from the holotype and other specimens in having five pairs of openings in the narial region, indicating that extensive morphological variability exists in the narial anatomy of P. grangeri. The specimen is identified as a juvenile based on its small size and the incomplete fusion of secondary dermal ossifications to the skull roof, exposing sutural boundaries. Juvenile ankylosaur skulls are rare, but crucial for understanding the basic anatomy of the highly fused and apomorphic adult skull. Morphological data from the new skull and other specimens are added to existing phylogenetic analyses of the Ankylosauria in order to identify diagnostic characters that aid in resolving ankylosaur relationships. The specimen also provides data on the ontogenetic sequence of secondary dermal ossification. Presence of dermal ossifications covering only the narial region, quadratojugals, and squamosals supports the hypothesis that osteoderms in these areas appear early in ontogeny. Furthermore, two well-developed osteoderms were found in close apposition but unfused to the ventrolateral edges of the mandible. All known mandibles from adult ankylosaurs exhibit fusion of these elements to the underlying bones. Thus, mandibular osteoderms also appear relatively early but do not become fused until much later.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Several recent studies using analyses of morphological characters have addressed the interrelationships of Osteoglossomorpha, a group that sometimes is considered the living sister group of all other living teleosts. Many characters used in these studies were found to be poorly defined, to be coded incorrectly or illogically, or to display more variation than was described. The goal of this study is to address these concerns and contribute generally to knowledge of the morphology and systematic relationships of osteoglossomorphs. Analysis of 72 characters (65 informative) scored for 20 genera resulted in two most parsimonious cladograms (171 steps, CI \&\#61; 0.6433, CI \&\#61; 0.6139 excluding uninformative characters, HI \&\#61; 0.3977, HI \&\#61; 0.3861 excluding uninformative characters; RI \&\#61; 0.7782; RC \&\#61; 0.5006). Osteoglossomorpha is supported by both synapomorphies and homoplasies, although its monophyly was not truly tested in this analysis (only a single outgroup, Elops , was included in the analysis). The only difference in the topologies of these cladograms is in the position of \&\#8224;Lycoptera (recovered as either the sister group of all other osteoglossomorphs sampled or of \&\#8224;Eohiodon \&\#43;Hiodon ). \&\#8224;Ostariostoma is recovered as the sister group of all non-hiodontiform osteoglossomorphs. Mormyrids are the sister group of notopterids \&\#43; osteoglossids. This clade has not been found in other recent analyses. Mormyrids and notopterids usually are considered more closely related to each other than to any other group; characters not included here support this relationship and future consideration of these characters must be made. Although almost completely dichotomous, many nodes of the resulting trees lack rigorous support. For example, \&\#8224;Palaeonotopterus is interpreted as the sister group of all mormyrids sampled, although for this taxon only 22\% of characters could be scored.\&\#8195;\&\#169; 2003 The Linnean Society of London.

  Abstract                 = {{Australia's dinosaurian fossil record is exceptionally poor compared to that of other similar-sized continents. Most taxa are known from fragmentary isolated remains with uncertain taxonomic and phylogenetic placement. A better understanding of the Australian dinosaurian record is crucial to understanding the global palaeobiogeography of dinosaurian groups, including groups previously considered to have had Gondwanan origins, such as the titanosaurs and carcharodontosaurids. We describe three new dinosaurs from the late Early Cretaceous (latest Albian) Winton Formation of eastern Australia, including; Wintonotitan wattsi gen. et sp. nov., a basal titanosauriform; Diamantinasaurus matildae gen. et sp. nov., a derived lithostrotian titanosaur; and Australovenator wintonensis gen. et sp. nov., an allosauroid. We compare an isolated astragalus from the Early Cretaceous of southern Australia; formerly identified as Allosaurus sp., and conclude that it most-likely represents Australovenator sp. The occurrence of Australovenator from the Aptian to latest Albian confirms the presence in Australia of allosauroids basal to the Carcharodontosauridae. These new taxa, along with the fragmentary remains of other taxa, indicate a diverse Early Cretaceous sauropod and theropod fauna in Australia, including plesiomorphic forms (e.g. Wintonotitan and Australovenator) and more derived forms (e.g. Diamantinasaurus).}},

Understanding variation in the cranial and postcranial skeleton is necessary for adequately representing ancestral character states for each mammalian order. This paper provides a comprehensive description and discussion of cranial and postcranial osteology in one of the major perissodactyl lineages, the Tapiromorpha, the lineage including the extant rhinoceroses and tapirs and their fossil relatives. Tapiromorph skeletal morphology is described, and tapiromorphs are compared to each other, to other perissodactyls, and to a number of other eutherians. Characters of potential phylogenetic significance are emphasized. A phylogenetic analysis of tapiromorphs using cranial and postcranial osteological characters provides a number of interesting results. The data do not support placing Homogalax and Chalicotherioidea within Tapiromorpha. The data support several novel hypotheses regarding the phylogeny of rhinocerotoids, including a close relationship between rhinocerotids and amynodontids, relative to hyracodontids. Finally, examples of the relevance of tapiromorph osteology to understanding perissodactyl origins are discussed, particularly new interpretations of certain primitive character states for perissodactyls.}},

The shape of the prefrontal, length of the quadrate ramus of the squamosal, and length of the quadrate and quadratojugal all indicate that the skull profile of Keichousaurus is much lower than previously thought. A new reconstruction attributes a distinctly eusauropterygian gestalt to the skull. A phylogenetic analysis, although equivocal, suggests that Keichousaurus is more appropriately considered a basal nothosauroid rather than a pachypleurosauroid, and that the Eusauropterygia is paraphyletic.}},

A cladistic analysis of the known species of Ansomys, as well as new material from Hepburn's Mesa and a few other morphologically similar species, prompted reconstruction of the biogeographic history of the genus. One new species, A. hepburnensis, from the Barstovian of Montana, is described, and two other species, A. nexodens and A. descendens, are placed in Ansomys rather than in Pseudallomys and Plesispermophilus, respectively. Addition of these three species to Ansomys extends its distribution throughout the Holarctic in the mid-Miocene. Stratigraphic ranges combined with phylogenetic relationships between species suggest this wide distribution as early as the late Oligocene, which is unique among aplodontid genera. The distribution, the rarity, the unusually small size, and the complex cusp morphology of Ansomys suggest a very specialized ecology for members of this clade.}},

Here we report on an exceptionally well-preserved small theropod specimen collected from the earliest Late Jurassic Tiaojishan Formation of western Liaoning, China2. The specimen is referable to the Troodontidae, which are among the theropods most closely related to birds. This new find refutes the 'temporal paradox'1 and provides significant information on the temporal framework of theropod divergence. Furthermore, the extensive feathering of this specimen, particularly the attachment of long pennaceous feathers to the pes, sheds new light on the early evolution of feathers and demonstrates the complex distribution of skeletal and integumentary features close to the dinosaur–bird transition.}},

Here we describe a new enantiornithine bird from the Lower Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of western Liaoning, China, Xiangornis shenmi, gen. et sp. nov., which further reduces the morphological gap between the two groups. Xiangornis shenmi has several enantiornithine features, including a furcula with a significantly elongated hypocleidium, a coracoid with a convex lateral margin, and a minor metacarpal that extends further distally than the major metacarpal. However, it also possesses some derived ornithurine features, such as a short alular metacarpal (about one-sixth as long as the major metacarpal) that is completely fused to the major metacarpal, a large extensor process on the alular metacarpal, proximal and distal fusion between the minor and major metacarpals, and an intermetacarpal space positioned significantly distal to the alular metacarpal. This new find indicates that a carpometacarpal morphology similar to that seen in modern birds probably evolved independently in enantiornithines and appeared earlier than in Ornithuromorpha, and demonstrates that character evolution in early birds was more complex than previously believed.}},

Argochampsa krebsi, n.g. n.sp., exhibits a particular shape of the anterior end of its premaxillae, transversely broad and strongly bent downwards, a shape found in distantly related taxa, such as pholidosaurids and Terminonaris. A phylogenetic analysis, suggests that A. krebsi is a primitive gavialoid, placed with Eogavialis africanum between ?thoracosaurs? (primitive Gavialoidea) and more derived taxa. This analysis supports the previous morphological analysis, which suggests a close relationship of Tomistominae with Crocodylinae, in contrast with the molecular analysis which give a closer relationships between Tomistoma and Gavialis. The marine nature of the layer where Argochampsa comes from is consistent with a marine origin for Argochampsa. This demonstrates the existence of marine adaptation in fossil species of primitive gavialoids, which may explain the dispersal of the fossil gavialoids to South America and Asia during and after the Oligocene.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Femoral osteology and soft tissues evolved in a stepwise pattern in archosauromorph reptiles on the line to crown group birds. Crocodylia retains most ancestral archosaurian traits, whereas Dinosauromorpha (including birds) acquired many more derived traits. The complex sequence of changes included major shifts of several thigh muscle insertions. Medial rotation of the proximal femur (e.g. the femoral head) in archosaurs moved the greater trochanter laterally, bringing along the insertion of M. pubo-ischio-femoralis externus. Within Dinosauromorpha, the lesser trochanter moved proximally away from the trochanteric shelf. Presumably the lesser trochanter indicates the insertion of M. iliotrochantericus caudalis whereas the trochanteric shelf indicates the insertion of M. iliofemoralis externus. An accessory trochanter at the base of the lesser trochanter marks the insertion of M. pubo-ischio-femoralis internus 2 in tetanuran theropods. I propose hypotheses for the homologies of several intermuscular lines and other features on the femoral shaft. On the line to Neornithes, most changes of femoral morphology predated Aves and the origin of flight; few femoral features are unique to birds. Overall, the pattern of morphological evolution is consistent with stepwise functional evolution of the hindlimb within Dinosauromorpha on the line to Neornithes. The clade Ornithurae evolved the last few hindlimb apomorphies that characterize extant birds, in conjunction with more flexed hip and knee joints.}},

The holotype specimen is nearly complete, lacking only the distal portion of the tail. It is the second largest theropod taxon discovered from Jehol Group sediments. Like all compsognathids, Huaxiagnathus has short forelimbs and a relatively unspecialised coelurosaur body plan. Previously, fairly complete skeletons existed for only two small?bodied taxa of compsognathids, Compsognathus longipes from the Late Jurassic of Western Europe and Sinosauropteryx prima, also from the Yixian. The phylogenetic position of Huaxiagnathus orientalis was analysed using an extensive matrix of theropod characters from many taxa. Huaxiagnathus orientalis fell out at the base of the Compso?gnathidae, as it lacks the forelimb adaptations of more derived compsognathids. The addition of Huaxiagnathus and the two other compsognathid species to our data matrix resulted in the placement of Compsognathidae near the base of Maniraptora. Furthermore, Alvarezsauridae, Paraves, and a monophyletic Therizinosauroidea + Oviraptorosauria clade fall out in an unresolved trichotomy in the strict consensus of our most parsimonious trees.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The hypothesis that birds are maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs (the ” BMT hypo­ thesis”) has become widely accepted by both scientists and the general public. Criticism has usu­ ally been dismissed, often with the comment that no more parsimonious alternative has been presented with cladistic methodology. Rather than taking that position, we ask here whether the hypothesis is as overwhelmingly supported as some claim. We reanalyzed a standard matrix of 46 taxa and 208 characters from a recent paper by Clark, Norell, and Makovicky, and we found statistical support for the clades Coelurosauria and Maniraptoriformes and for a clade of birds and maniraptorans. Note, however, that because the matrix contains only birds and theropods, it assumes that the origin of birds lies within the Theropoda. In addition to this problem, Clark et al.'s (2002) matrix contains problematic assumptions of homology, especially in the palate, basipterygoid, manus, carpus, and tarsus. In an attempt to avoid these two major problems and to evaluate the BMT hypothesis and four alternative hypotheses in a comparative phylogenetic framework, we followed the recommendations of Jenner, Kearney, and Rieppel by constructing and analyzing a larger but more conservative matrix. Our matrix includes taxa from throughout the Archosauria. When the ambiguous characters were excluded, parsimony analyses with boot­ strapping and successive pruning retrieved a weak clade of birds and core maniraptorans (ovirap­ torosaurs, troodontids, and dromaeosaurs) that also contained the early archosaur Longisquama and was not unambiguously associated with other theropods. When the ambiguous characters were included but coded as unknown where appropriate, the results were virtually identical. Kishino-Hasegawa tests revealed no statistical difference between the hypothesis that birds were a clade nested within the Maniraptora and the hypothesis that core clades of Maniraptora were actually flying and flightless radiations within the clade bracketed by Archaeopteryx and mod­ ern birds (Aves). Additional statistical tests showed that both the ” early-archosaur” and ” cro­ codylomorph” hypotheses are at least as well supported as the BMT hypothesis. These results show that Theropoda as presently constituted may not be monophyletic and that the verification­ ist approach of the BMT literature may be producing misleading studies on the origin of birds. Further research should focus on whether some maniraptorans belong within Aves, and whether Aves belongs within Theropoda or is more closely related to another archosaurian taxon. At pres­ ent, uncertainties about the hypothesis that birds are maniraptoran theropods are not receiving enough attention}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract Taxonomic revision and cladistic analysis of a morphological dataset for Australian Tertiary temnopleurids resolve the phylogeny of the group and allow the testing of a series of hypotheses about the evolution of larval development and consequences of changes in development. Australian Tertiary temnopleurids encompass all three major developmental types found in marine invertebrates (planktotrophy, lecithotrophy, and brooding). Planktotrophy is plesiomorphic for this clade, and nonplanktotrophic larval development evolved independently at least three times during the Tertiary. The change to a nonplanktotrophic mode of larval development is unidirectional with no evidence of reversal. In addition, there is no evidence of an ordered transformation series from planktotrophy through planktonic lecithotrophy to brooding. In common with previous studies of other invertebrate groups, analysis of the raw data suggests that nonplanktotrophic taxa within this clade have significantly shorter species longevities, more restricted geographic ranges and higher speciation rates than taxa with planktotrophic development. However, analysis using phylogenetically independent contrasts is unable to confirm that the stratigraphic and geographic patterns are unbiased by the phylogenetic relationships of the included taxa.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT A new nearly complete skeleton from the Wayao Member of the Falang Formation (lower Carnian, Upper Triassic) of Guizhou, South China, is described and ascribed as a juvenile individual of Guanlingsaurus liangae. The new specimen supplies hitherto unknown information on this species: a complete pelvic girdle shows that the ilium was misidentified as the ischium by previous authors; complete hyoids show that their length was overestimated previously; unlike in other shastasaurids, the obturator foramen on the pubis is widely open as part of the obturator fossa; and the fibula has a posterior flange, similar to that of Shonisaurus. Guanlingsaurus liangae was reassigned to the genus Shastasaurus and was suggested to be a suction feeder due to its short snout, lack of teeth, and hyoid. However, the new specimen of Guanlingsaurus described here shows much smaller hyoids compared with Shonisaurus, which was thought to be a suction-feeding ichthyosaur. Suction feeding in ichthyopterygians as a whole requires scrutiny: the group lacks an ossified hyoid corpus that is typically expanded in suction-feeding cetaceans, which suggests that ichthyopterygian hyoids were insufficiently robust for suction feeding. A phylogenetic analysis of Ichthyopterygia based on a revised data matrix clarifies the shastasaurid affinity of G. liangae as a sister taxon of Shonisaurus, with Shastasaurus as their sister group, and Shonisaurus is reestablished as a genus containing Shonisaurus sikanniensis as traditionally held. It suggests that the assignment of Guanlingsaurus and Shonisaurus sikanniensis to Shastasaurus unnecessarily confuses existing taxonomy.a SUPPLEMENTAL DATA?Supplemental materials are available for this article for free at www.tandfonline.com/UJVP}},

The most abundant taxon amongst these is the ornithuromorph Gansus yumenensis, but enantiornithines have also been identified in the sample. Here we describe two incomplete, semi-articulated appendicular skeletons, the first consisting of a partial left pelvic girdle and complete pelvic limb, and the second comprised of a nearly complete right pelvic limb. Both specimens bear characteristics diagnostic of Enantiornithes, and are referred to a new taxon, Qiliania graffinigen. et sp. nov. The exceptional, three-dimensional preservation of these specimens (compared to the crushed, nearly two-dimensional condition of most other Early Cretaceous avian fossils) reveals new information regarding enantiornithine anatomy, evolution, and diversity. {\copyright} 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 162, 201–219.}},

Diagnostic characters of the new species include a short posteroventral jugal process and the absence of external contact between jugal and quadratojugal. The morphologic description of the type specimens amends the knowledge of the postorbital region and the postcranium of the Mixosauridae. The holotype of Mixosaurus maotaiensis, which is very fragmentary and has no taxonomic value at the species level, is found to be undiagnostic, and hence the lately introduced, monospecific genus name for this species needs to be abandoned. Phylogenetic analysis strongly supports the monophyly of the family Mixosauridae. Furthermore, the analysis shows a bifurcation of the family into two sister groups, suggesting the presence of two genera, Mixosaurus and Phalarodon. Mixosaurus, characterized by a relatively short and wide humerus, includes M. panxianensis sp. nov., M. cornalianus, and M. kuhnschnyderi. Synapomorphies of Phalarodon, which contains P. fraasi, P. callawayi, and P. atavus, are a narial shelf and the absence of a maxillary dental groove.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract Reexamination of type and topotype material revealed the presence of well-developed ventral and dorsal interareas in two virgianid brachiopods from South China, Eoconchidium jiangshanensis Liang (in Liu et al., 1983) and Paraconchidium shiqianensis Rong, Xu, and Yang, 1974, of Late Ordovician and Early Silurian ages, respectively. A cladistic analysis of the common virgianid taxa, incorporating new data on the development of interareas, confirms Paraconchidium Rong, Xu, and Yang, 1974 as a valid genus (not a junior synonym of Pseudoconchidium Nikiforova and Sapelnikov, 1971) and warrants E. jiangshanensis as the type species of Deloprosopus new genus (not allied to either Eoconchidium or Tcherskidium as previously believed). Our preliminary survey on the suborder Pentameridina, based on available material or illustrations of well-preserved, disarticulated (typically silicified) valves, indicates that 1) the interareas are more commonly developed in the superfamily Pentameroidea than was reported previously, especially in the families Virgianidae and Subrianidae; 2) the ventral and dorsal interareas commonly do not occur as paired planar surfaces in the Pentameroidea, as they do in the superfamily Stricklandioidea; and 3) despite the common absence of a ventral interarea, the development of a sharply delimited dorsal interarea appears to be ubiquitous in the Pentameroidea and possibly in the suborder Pentameridina. In the currently adopted classification, the presence of matching ventral and dorsal interareas is treated as one of the diagnostic characters that separate Stricklandioidea from other superfamilies of the Pentameridina. The new data presented herein on the development of interareas imply the need to reevaluate the taxonomic and evolutionary significance of the ventral and dorsal interareas, pending a thorough survey on their distribution in the suborder Pentameridina.}},

Gooloogongia loomesi is known from well-preserved cranial and postcranial material, and as such represents the most complete rhizodont known. Newly discovered elements (braincase, pelvic girdle) are described for the first time. Aztecia mahalae gen. nov., sp. nov. is based on shoulder girdle material formerly assigned to Notorhizodon Young et al. 1992, which, based on skull and lower jaw morphology, is a member of the Tristichopteridae. The presence of several plesiomorphic characters suggests that Gooloogongia occupies a basal phylogenetic position within the Rhizodontida, while Aztecia n. gen. possesses a more derived shoulder girdle. We argue that the Rhizodontida evolved on the Gondwanan landmass. Notorhizodon occupies a relatively derived position within the Tristichopteridae, but is contemporary with the earliest and phylogenetically most basal Laurussian members of the group. This shows that the tristichopterids achieved a worldwide distribution considerably earlier than previously thought.}},

This can only be achieved through a phylogenetic analysis of sarcopterygians. Sarcopterygian fin skeletons vary in structure8,9; use of an inappropriate fin skeleton as a model limb precursor will lead to erroneous inferences about the evolution of morphology and the developmental pathways at the fish–tetrapod transition. The pectoral fin of the rhizodont sarcopterygian Sauripteris is strikingly limb-like and features prominently in discussions about the origin of limbs3,7,10, 11, 12, 13, 14. It is thus important to establish the phylogenetic position of rhizodonts. However, their anatomy is incompletely known15,16. Published phylogenetic analyses are based on poorly substantiated characters, such as the alleged presence of two external nostrils in the Australian genus Barameda 17,18. Here we present, from the Upper Devonian period of Canowindra, Australia, the most primitive and by far the most complete rhizodont discovered so far. It has a single external nostril but possesses no other derived tetrapod-like features. Our new evidence shows that rhizodonts are more remote from tetrapods than are osteolepiform18 and elpistostegid19 lobe-fin fishes. Similarities between rhizodont fins and tetrapod limbs are thus probably convergent, and the pectoral fin of Sauripteris should not be used as a model limb precursor.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Accurate hypotheses of primary homology are fundamental to many aspects of the systematics and palaeobiology of fossils. They are particularly critical for conodonts: virtually all areas of conodont research are underpinned by homology, yet the majority of conodont taxa are found only as disarticulated skeletal elements, and hypotheses of element homology are inferred from morphological comparisons with complete skeletons. This can cause problems in taxa where more than one location within the conodont skeleton is occupied by elements with similar morphology. In such cases, morphological comparisons can yield equivocal or erroneous hypotheses of homology of isolated elements. The Eramosa Lagerst\"{a}tte of Ontario (Silurian, Wenlock) preserves both isolated skeletal elements and articulated conodont skeletons. The latter provide a topological context within which to test hypotheses of element homology and allow blind testing of qualitative discrimination of elements. When applied to P1 and P2 elements of Wurmiella excavata, this revealed inaccuracy and inconsistency in distinguishing these P element types. Standardised morphometric protocols were used to further test the efficacy of those characters used in traditional qualitative identification of P element homology, revealing that, individually, none of these characters provides an effective discriminator between P element types. Principal components and discriminant function analyses of ten 'traditional' morphological variables combined can distinguish P1 from P2 elements with a similar success rate to expert identification. Eigenshape and elliptic Fourier analyses of element outlines proved less effective at capturing shape differences that allowed for discrimination between P1 and P2 elements. Analysis of both traditional and outline data demonstrates that in some individuals P1 and P2 elements are morphologically distinct from one another, while in others they are almost indistinguishable. These results demonstrate that although qualitative assessments of homology can be prone to error, especially when undertaken by inexperienced researchers, the morphometric and analytical protocols used here provide effective additional tool for discriminating morphologically similar but non-homologous elements. These methods thus hold promise of broad application to other conodont taxa where identification of element homology in collections of isolated specimens is problematic.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract Presented herein is the first morphological analysis of turtle relationships to examine the monophyly of many turtle groups by using only single species as terminals and by integrating a large number of primitive fossil taxa. The data matrix consists of 136 osteological parsimony informative characters with 169 derived character states for 45 fossil and 22 living species of the clade Testudinata. The results corroborate the monophyly of a large number of previously hypothesized clades, but refute the accepted hypothesis regarding the basal split of living turtles. In particular, the primitive turtles Proterochersis robusta, Kayentachelys aprix, Mongolochelys efremovi, Meiolania platyceps, and Kallokibotion bajazidi are removed from their current position as crown turtles and placed along the phylogenetic stem of this clade. The age of the turtle crown is thereby adjusted from the Late Triassic to the Late Jurassic, which is relevant to testing molecular clock hypotheses. This revised topology has important implications for the evolution of several character complexes, because it implies that the common ancestor of all living turtles must have had a partially braced brain case and a primitive trochlear mechanism. Other noteworthy conclusions include the tentative exclusion of protostegids from Chelonioidea, the placement of Platysternon megacephalum outside of Chelydridae, and the tentative interpretation of Sandownia harrisi as a basal eucryptodire.}},

For this reason third codon positions are often regarded as less reliable than first and second positions as indicators of phylogeny. Analysis of the largest nucleotide matrix treated to date—2538 rbc L sequences covering all major lineages of green plants—shows the opposite: although rapidly evolving and highly homoplastic, third positions contain most of the phylogenetic structure in the data. Frequency of change should thus be used with caution as a criterion for weighting or selecting characters.}},

Nine of these species are illustrated for the first time herein. Sixteen are considered valid, including C. deroseari n. sp. Of the remaining three species, one is left in open nomenclature, and two are considered nomen dubia. Pellecrinus is recognized for the first time from the Burlington Limestone, although the specimens can not be identified to the species level and are left in open nomenclature. Cyathocrinites ranges from the Middle Silurian to at least the Middle Mississippian. During the Early Mississippian Cyathocrinites experienced an evolutionary radiation with a maximum diversity of nine species in the Burlington Limestone. Phylogenetic relationships were investigated in a parsimony-based phylogenetic analysis by combining morphologic data from the Burlington species with data from the four other species of Cyathocrinites from the late Osagean and early Meramecian of the east-central United States. The Kinderhookian C. chouteauensis (Miller and Gurley, 1896) served as the outgroup. A phylogenetic analysis of 14 species of Mississippian Cyathocrinites yielded a single most parsimonious tree with a length of 28 steps (C. I. = 0.607, H. I. = 0.392, R. I. = 0.718, R. C. = 0.436). Results of this analysis suggest that at least two major clades existed within Mississippian Cyathocrinites. One clade contains C. sampsoni (Miller, 1891b), C. gilesi (Wachsmuth and Springer, 1878), C. farleyi (Meek and Worthen, 1866), and C. barydactylus (Wachsmuth and Springer, 1878). The second clade contains C. iowensis, C. kelloggi (White, 1862), C. barrisi (Hall, 1861a), C. rigidus, C. deroseari n. sp., C. asperrimus (Springer, 1911), C. lamellosus (White, 1863), and C. harrodi (Wachsmuth and Springer, 1880). Cyathocrinites multibrachiatus forms a polytomy with these two clades. Members of the first clade exhibit a unique overall morphology present only during the Mississippian, suggesting the clade arose during this time. Members of the second clade, plus C. multibrachiatus, exhibit some characters present in Cyathocrinites species as old as the Middle Silurian and, thus, may have its roots among Silurian and Devonian species.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract New craniodental material of the traversodontid Dadadon isaloi from Middle/Upper Triassic basal ?Isalo II? beds of southwestern Madagascar is described. These specimens reveal several new autapomorphies of Dadadon, including paired foramina on the frontal near the anterior border of the postorbital and lower incisors with denticulated distal margins. The new material covers a broad size range, providing the first information on ontogeny in Dadadon. Larger (presumably older) specimens of Dadadon isaloi have more postcanine teeth, relatively longer, narrower snouts, and a higher degree of cranial ornamentation than smaller specimens. Postcanine replacement in Dadadon was similar to that of other traversodontids: new teeth erupted at the posterior end of the postcanine tooth row and moved forward. Using information from the new specimens, the position of Dadadon was tested in a new phylogenetic analysis of traversodontids. In the new analysis, Dadadon is strongly supported as a member of a clade also including the South American taxa Massetognathus and Santacruzodon, here named Massetognathinae subfam. nov. This clade is diagnosed by the presence of denticulated lower incisors, relatively small canines, three cusps in the labial margin of the upper postcanines, and low, flat skulls. Massetognathinae is the sister-group of Gomphodontosuchinae, which includes Gomphodontosuchus, Menadon, Protuberum, Exaeretodon, and Scalenodontoides. The Laurasian traversodontids (Arctotraversodon, Boreogomphodon, and Nanogomphodon) form a clade that is the sister-taxon of Massetognathinae + Gomphodontosuchinae. Denticulated incisors evolved multiple times in traversodontid evolution (in massetognathines and Arctotraversodon), and thus this group represents another possibility (besides various archosauromorphs) to be considered when attempting to identify isolated Triassic teeth with denticulated carinae lacking cingula.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract A phylogenetic analysis of 14 genera of the family Goneplacidae MacLeay (Decapoda: Brachyura: Xanthoidea) is presented based upon 45 adult morphological characters. Two most-parsimonious trees were obtained (length = 87, CI = 0.6667, RI = 0.8242, RC = 0.5495). The present analysis suggests that the Goneplacidae is divided into six subfamilies: Carinocarcinoidinae subfam. nov., Chasmocarcininae Ser\`{e}ne, Euryplacinae Stimpson, Goneplacinae MacLeay, Mathildellinae subfam. nov., and Trogloplacinae Guinot. The Carcinoplacinae H. Milne Edwards is synonymised with the Goneplacinae. The family and six subfamilies are defined or redefined based upon the phylogenetic analysis. Within the Goneplacidae, the Trogloplacinae and Chasmocarcininae are sister groups nested as the most derived clade, followed by the Carinocarcinoidinae, Goneplacinae, Euryplacinae, and the most basal Mathildellinae. Our analysis supports recognition of the family Pseudoziidae Alcock by Ng and Liao and suggests that it is the sister to the Eriphiidae MacLeay. A reexamination of fossil records of the Goneplacidae shows that 62 species, 20 genera, and five subfamilies are recognized as fossils. A new monotypic genus Viaplax (Euryplacinae) is erected for Pilumnoplax urpiniana Via. Chlinocephalus Ristori and Gillcarcinus Collins and Morris are moved to the Goneplacidae. Paleopsopheticus Hu and Tao is synonymised with Psopheticus Wood-Mason. Glaessneria Takeda and Miyake is here the junior synonym of Goneplax. Eleven extinct genera previously assigned to the Goneplacidae are not referred to any subfamilies and are transferred out of the Goneplacidae. New combinations include: Carcinoplax proavita (Glaessner), Goneplax arenicola (Glaessner), Euphylax zariquieri (Via) (Portunidae Rafinesque), and Psopheticus shujienae (Hu and Tao).}},

This study suggests that the most primitive taxon is the Anurognathidae, followed by Sordes and all remaining pterosaurs. Dendrorhynchoides is confirmed as a member of the Anurognathidae, being closely related to Batrachognathus. Preondactylus occupies a more derived position than Sordes, which questions its previous assignment as the most primitive pterosaur. The hypothesis of rhamphorhynchoid paraphyly is confirmed, with the Rhamphorhynchidae more closely related to the Pterodactyloidea than to more basal forms. The Pterodactyloidea shows a basal dichotomy: the Archaeopterodactyloidea and the Dsungaripteroidea. The Archaeopterodactyloidea is formed by Pterodactylus + Germanodactylus and a clade formed by Gallodactylidae + Ctenochasmatidae. The Nyctosauridae occupies the basal position within dsungaripteroids and is followed by the Pteranodontoidea and the Tapejaroidea. Pteranodontoids have Pteranodon at the base, followed stepwise by Istiodactylus, Ornithocheirus and the Anhangueridae. Tapejaroids are composed of the Dsungaripteridae at the base followed by the Tapejaridae and the Azhdarchidae. Major trends within pterosaur evolutionary history are: general increase in size (wing span and body); increase of wing metacarpal and pteroid; decrease of proportional length of the second and third wing phalanx relative to the first; gradual increase of rostrum (anterior to external nares); and anterior shift of the skull-mandible articulation. Cranial crests are present in most pterodactyloids, but markedly in the Ornithocheiroidea, where all taxa show some sort of crest on the skull. The loss of teeth, previously assumed to have occurred independently in several lineages, seems to be a general trend among dsungaripteroids. Several nodes recovered by this analysis are supported by very few characters, a result at least partially attributable to the limited available information from several taxa due to poor preservation and/or preparation. 10.1144/GSL.SP.2003.217.01.10}},

We recover two key novel results: a monophyletic Plesiosauridae comprising Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus, Hydrorion brachypterygius, Microcleidus homalospondylus, Occitanosaurus tournemirensis and Seeleyosaurus guilelmiimperatoris; and five plesiosaurian taxa recovered outside the split between Plesiosauroidea and Pliosauroidea. These taxa are Attenborosaurus conybeari, 'Plesiosaurus'macrocephalus and a clade comprising Archaeonectrus rostratus, Macroplata tenuiceps and BMNH 49202. Based on this result, a new name, Neoplesiosauria, is erected for the clade comprising Plesiosauroidea and Pliosauroidea. Taxon subsamples of the new dataset are used to simulate previous investigations of global plesiosaurian relationships. Based on these simulations, most major differences between previous global phylogenetic hypotheses can be attributed to differences in taxon sampling. These include the position of Leptocleididae and Polycotylidae and the monophyly or paraphyly of Rhomaleosauridae. On this basis we favour the results recovered by our, larger analysis. Leptocleididae and Polycotylidae are sister taxa, forming a monophyletic clade within Plesiosauroidea, indicating that the large-headed, short-necked 'pliosauromorph' body plan evolved twice within Plesiosauria. Rhomaleosauridae forms the monophyletic sister taxon of Pliosauridae within Pliosauroidea. Problems are identified with previous phylogenetic definitions of plesiosaurian clades and new, stem-based definitions are presented that should maintain their integrity over a range of phylogenetic hypotheses. New, rank-free clade names Cryptoclidia and Leptocleidia are erected to replace the superfamilies Cryptoclidoidea and Leptocleidoidea. These were problematic as they were nested within the superfamily Plesiosauroidea. The incongruence length difference test indicates no significant difference in levels of homoplasy between cranial and postcranial characters.}},

The anatomy of the agnathan brain and craniate phylogeny. 2014Acta Zoologica (Stockholm), 90 (Suppl. 1): 52201369 The central nervous system of hagfishes displays unique characteristics that are distinct from any other craniate neuroanatomic features. Whether these hagfish characters are general for all craniates, autapomorphies of hagfishes, or merely a derived state of the general cyclostome condition is still a matter of debate that relates to the question of the monophyly or paraphyly of the cyclostomes. The present cladistic study includes 123 neuroanatomical characters of nine chordate species and supports cyclostome paraphyly, in contrast to most current molecular sequence-based phylogenies, which support cyclostome monophyly. An understanding of the unique neural characters in hagfishes is critical to inspiring further comparative and developmental studies with regards to these two conflicting results and the very deep divergence between craniates and their presumed sister groups. The recent access to hagfish developmental data may provide exciting perspectives in the understanding and characterization of the basalmost craniate node and the interpretation of hagfish brain structure.}},

This specimen possesses a crest-like fourth trochanter, which is similar to those in dromaeosaurids such as Adasaurus mongoliensis and Velociraptor mongoliensis, suggesting a possible close phylogenetic relationship to these taxa. Non-avian maniraptorans including dromaeosaurids have been found in roughly contemporaneous deposits in China and Japan.

Although more than a dozen therizinosauroid taxa are known, their relationships within Dinosauria have remained controversial because of fragmentary remains and an unusual suite of characters. The recently discovered 'feathered' therizinosauroid Beipiaosaurus from the Early Cretaceous of China helped to clarify the theropod affinities of the group3. However, Beipiaosaurus is also poorly represented. Here we describe a new, primitive therizinosauroid from an extensive paucispecific bonebed at the base of the Cedar Mountain Formation (Early Cretaceous) of east-central Utah4, 5. This new taxon represents the most complete and most basal therizinosauroid yet discovered. Phylogenetic analysis of coelurosaurian theropods incorporating this taxon places it at the base of the clade Therizinosauroiden, indicating that this species documents the earliest known stage in the poorly understood transition from carnivory to herbivory within Therizinosauroidea. The taxon provides the first documentation, to our knowledge, of therizinosauroids in North America during the Early Cretaceous.}},

We generated multiple random data matrices for each of 49 different matrix sizes ranging from 5 taxa and 4 (binary) characters to 49 taxa and 124 characters. The CI of the minimum-length tree(s) was calculated for each. CIs decreased in a monotonic, nonlinear fashion with addition of either taxa or characters. The influence of addition of taxa was far greater than that of addition of characters, and an interaction effect was recognized. The general curvilinear relation we found between CIs and number of taxa is consistent with results obtained by other authors, but our random data CIs were lower than those of other studies. Mean random CIs varied from 0.70 for the smallest data sets to 0.072 for the largest. Maximum random CIs reached 0.80. A regression through means of random CIs against number of taxa was calculated with a 95\% confidence interval. This CI<sub>random</sub> is the minimum value that real data sets should exceed to be considered to contain phylogenetic information. The CIs of real data sets can be adjusted with the CI<sub>random</sub>, and these values are found to meet current criteria for adequate measures of homoplasy. However, the homoplasy indices that are uncorrelated with taxa are also insensitive to internal data set structure, and no current index is adequate for comparison of homoplasy among data sets.}},

It resembles largely the skull morphology of Nothosaurus marchicus. Differences concern beside the size, the straight rectangular and relative broad parietals, the short posterior extent of the maxilla, the skull proportions, and the overall low number of maxillary teeth. In spite of its small size, the skull can not unequivocally be interpreted as juvenile. It shows fused premaxillae, nasals, frontals, and parietals, a nearly co-ossified jugal, and fully developed braincase elements, such as a basisphenoid and massive epipterygoids. Adding the specimen to an existing phylogenetic analysis shows that it should be assigned to a new species, Nothosaurus winkelhorsti sp. nov., at least until its juvenile status can be unequivocally verified. Nothosaurus winkelhorsti sp. nov. represents, together with Nothosaurus juvenilis, the most basal nothosaur, so far.}},

Features that distinguish it from other Lower Permian seymouriamorphs (Discosauriscus, Ariekanerpeton, Seymouria) are: broad anterior portion of the interclavicle stem, merging indistinctly into the interclavicle plate; absence of a bulge in the anterior half of such a stem; presence of at least 28 presacral vertebrae; gastralia. The poorly ossified limbs of the largest Utegenia specimens are similar in degree of development to those of larval Discosauriscus, but the almost cylindrical, anterior trunk pleurocentra recall the condition of early juvenile Discosauriscus. A phylogeny of the best known seymouriamorphs, using a small but diverse exemplar from other early tetrapod groups, places Utegenia within seymouriamorphs as sister taxon to discosauriscids (Ariekanerpeton plus Discosauriscus). This conclusion affects origin and dispersal scenarios for seymouriamorphs, and supports the hypothesis of a widespread geographical record of Lower Permian taxa spanning across western Euramerica and eastern Asia.}},

Some features of Fukuisaurus show affinities with Iguanodon, Ouranosaurus, and Altirhinus, referred to as Iguanodontidae by some. A phylogenetic analysis using mainly cranial characters shows that Fukuisaurus is a definitive derived non-hadrosaurid iguanodontian and implies that Fukuisaurus is more derived than the clade of Iguanodon + Ouranosaurus and more basal to the clade of Altirhinus, Probactrosaurus, Eolambia, Protohadros, Bactrosaurus, Telmatosaurus, and hadrosaurids. It also supports that Iguanodontidae is paraphyletic by the exclusion of Altirhinus as suggested previously. The presence of Fukuisaurus indicates a wider geographical distribution of the group in eastern Asia. The occurrences of derived non-hadrosaurid iguanodontians from the Kitadani Formation and other formations in Japan support a dispersal of this group into eastern Asia by the Early Cretaceous and its temporal range extension in Japan. Fukuisaurus possesses a strong maxilla-vomer articulation, indicative of the independent acquisition of a non-pleurokinetic skull (not present in Hypsilophodon, Iguanodon, and hadrosaurids).}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Phylogenetic relationships among the diverse Cretaceous sauropods of East Asia have long been controversial. Debate has centered on whether there is any evidence for an endemic clade of Asian species ( ” Euhelopodidae”) and on the placement of these taxa within the context of higher sauropod phylogeny. While most Cretaceous sauropod taxa from Asia are recognized as part of Somphospondyli, recent discoveries have suggested Brachiosauridae may have dispersed into Asia as well. We present new fossils and analyses bearing on these issues. Additional material of the holotype individual of Erketu ellisoni recovered on a subsequent visit to the type locality expands the character data available for this unique sauropod. Associated sauropod dorsal and caudal vertebrae were collected from the same horizon, at a location approximately 2 km from the holotype excavation. The dorsal vertebra exhibits synapomorphies suggesting a representative of Titanosauria co-occurred with Erketu ellisoni. These new specimens, as well as recent discoveries of contemporary Asian sauropod taxa, allow a basis for phylogenetic reappraisal of Erketu and related taxa. Phylogenetic results support a sister group relationship between the Asian Cretaceous sauropods Erketu and Qiaowanlong. Although Qiaowanlong was described as a brachiosaurid, it joins Erketu on the somphospondylian side of the Brachiosauridae-Somphospondyli divergence, erasing the evidence for the dispersal of Brachiosauridae into Asia.}},

The specimen comprises a well-preserved articulated anterior cervical series, an articulated lower hindlimb, and a sternal plate. This sauropod displays a unique combination of features including low, bifid neural spines, elongate cervical centra, and crescent-shaped sternal plates. Computed tomography imaging reveals the vertebrae were extensively invaded with pneumatic camellae. The holotype individual of Erketu was of modest mass relative to other neosauropods, but had an extremely elongate neck. Phylogenetic analysis indicates Erketu is a member of the Somphospondyli and may belong to a more exclusive clade therein.}},

Lamplughsaura dharmaramensis n. gen. and sp., represented by several partial skeletons, is a heavily built quadrupedal form (body length ?10 m). Autapomorphies include teeth with strongly emarginated distal edge; caudal cervical neural spines bearing a vertically oriented ligamentous furrow on cranial and caudal surfaces and a transversely expanded spine table; caudal neural spines bearing a craniodorsally directed spur (proximal caudal vertebrae) or a large process (midcaudal vertebrae); caudal neural spines shorter than transverse processes so former lost first in passing along tail; and a plesiomorphy that is the nontrenchant form of manual ungual I. The Indian dinosaurs were coded for two recent datamatrices for basal sauropodomorphs. The results of this preliminary analysis indicate that Lamplughsaura is either a basal Sauropoda or, less likely, based on Templeton's test, a stem sauropodomorph. The second large form, represented by the proximal half of a femur, is a sauropodomorph that is more derived than Saturnalia (Brazil) and Thecodontosaurus (Great Britain) from the Upper Triassic. This is also true for the smaller (body length ?4 m as adult) Pradhania gracilis n. gen. and sp. which lies outside of the Sauropoda + Plateosauria clade, so it is definitely a stem sauropodomorph. Pradhania is known from fragmentary material; an autapomorphy is the very prominent medial longitudinal ridge on the maxilla.}},

The described material belongs to two juvenile individuals. Recent field work has provided new cranial and post-cranial material. This new material presents a combination of plesiomorphic and apomorphic eusauropod characters adding more data to the skull and the post-cranial skeletal morphology. A phylogenetic analysis (237 characters, 39 taxa: 16 parsimonious trees of 479 steps, CI = 0.53, RI = 0.73) (L\"{a}ng 2008) indicates an unsolved phylogenetic position of Chebsaurus within the non-neosauropod Eusauropoda. Indeed, Chebsaurus is positioned in a multifurcation with Middle Jurassic ?cetiosaurids? Lapparentosaurus madagascariensis, Ferganasaurus verzilini, ?Cetiosaurus mogrebiensis and Cetiosaurus oxoniensis from Oxford. This polytomy could be explained by numerous missing data and also by the incongruence of the informative characters for the Middle Jurassic basal eusauropods. The latter could result from an evolutive radiation that might have succeeded the extinction at the end of the Early Jurassic (Pliensbachian?Toarcian) and/or the Pangea break-up.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Oviraptorids are a group of specialized non-avian theropod dinosaurs that were generally one to 8 m in body length. New specimens of baby oviraptorids from the Late Cretaceous of Henan Province are some of the smallest individuals known. They include diagnostic characters such as the relative position of the antorbital fenestra and the external naris, distinct opening in the premaxilla anteroventral to the external naris, antorbital fossa partly bordered by premaxilla posterodorsally, lacrimal process of premaxilla does not contact the anterodorsal process of the lacrimal, parietal almost as long as frontal; in dorsal view, posterior margin forms a straight line between the postzygapophyses in each of the fourth and fifth cervicals; femur longer than ilium. They also elucidate the ontogenetic processes of oviraptorids, including fusion of cranial elements and changes in relative body proportions. Hind limb proportions are constant in oviraptorids, regardless of absolute body size or ontogenetic stage. This suggests a sedentary lifestyle that did not involve the pursuit of similar-sized prey. The functional implications for bite force and therefore dietary preferences are better understood through the study of such small animals. The comparison of the measurements of 115 skeletons indicates that oviraptorids maintain their hind limb proportions regardless of ontogenetic stage or absolute size, which is a pattern seen more commonly in herbivores than in carnivores. This may weakly support the hypothesis that oviraptorids are herbivores rather than active carnivores.}},

The new taxon is edentulous, with a relatively large skull and a remarkably large, tall nasoantorbital fenestra that extends well above the main part of the braincase. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Shenzhoupterus gen. nov. belongs in a distinct clade of azhdarchoid pterosaurs, formally recognised here as a new family, Chaoyangopteridae, that also includes Chaoyangopterus, Jidapterus and Eoazhdarcho from the Jiufotang Formation and Eopteranodon from the Yixian Formation.

Frustratingly, relevant fossils are still comparatively rare, most transitions have yet to be documented in detail and the mechanisms that underpin such events, typified by rapid large scale changes and for which microevolutionary processes seem insufficient, are still unclear. A new pterosaur (Mesozoic flying reptile) from the Middle Jurassic of China, gen. et sp. nov., provides the first insights into a prominent, but poorly understood transition between basal, predominantly long-tailed pterosaurs and the more derived, exclusively short-tailed pterodactyloids. exhibits a remarkable 'modular' combination of characters: the skull and neck are typically pterodactyloid, exhibiting numerous derived character states, while the remainder of the skeleton is almost completely plesiomorphic and identical to that of basal pterosaurs. This pattern supports the idea that modules, tightly integrated complexes of characters with discrete, semi-independent and temporally persistent histories, were the principal focus of natural selection and played a leading role in evolutionary transitions.}},

The new maxilla shares derived characters with the maxillae of Carnotaurus and Majungatholus, and with AMNH 1955, a maxilla previously referred to Indosuchus, suggesting that it pertains to the abelisaurid subclade Carnotaurinae. Abelisaurus shares apomorphic characters with Carnotaurinae, but many of these characters are also found in the carcharodontosaurid allosauroid Giganotosaurus. As it is known only from cranial material lacking carnotaurine synapomorphies, Abelisaurus may represent a late-surviving carcharodontosaurid derivative. The presence of the Bajo Barreal predator in the early Late Cretaceous indicates that the origin of Abelisauridae had occurred by then. The occurrence of the new maxilla is nearly concurrent with the accepted interval of tectonic divergence between South America and Africa. Its discovery thus weakens support for the recent hypothesis that the abelisaurid clade could not have penetrated Africa. The known occurrence of Abehsauridae may reflect a former pan-Gondwanan distribution, and is thus of limited utility in the support of Late Cretaceous paleogeographic hypotheses.}},

For the first time a phylogenetic analysis of a number of synziphosurine and xiphosurid taxa is performed together with representatives of the other chelicerate orders also included as ingroup taxa. Xiphosura as currently defined is shown to be paraphyletic, and a revised classification is presented. Previous characteristics used to unite the xiphosurids (possessing a fused thoracetron) and a paraphyletic grade of synziphosurines (retaining freely articulating opisthosomal tergites) include the presence of a cardiac lobe, ophthalmic ridges, an axial region of the opisthosoma, and a reduced first opisthosomal segment. All of these characteristics are, however, here shown to be present in other chelicerate groups, leaving Xiphosura without any defining synapomorphies. A number of other characters, including the form of the chelicerae and appendage VII, indicate that xiphosurans may be paraphyletic with respect to a clade consisting of chasmataspidids, eurypterids, and arachnids. What ramifications this has for the evolution of basal chelicerates is briefly discussed, and it is recognized that most of the currently known 'synziphosurine' taxa represent offshoots from the main chelicerate lineage with ghost ranges extending into at least the Middle Ordovician.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Early dinosaur evolution has been the subject of several phylogenetic studies and the position of certain basal forms is currently debated. This is the case for the oldest known members of the group, excavated from the Late Triassic Ischigualastian beds of South America, such as Herrerasaurus, Eoraptor, Pisanosaurus, Saturnalia and Staurikosaurus. A new cladistic analysis of the early dinosaur radiation was performed to assess the relationships among the three major clades (Ornithischia, Sauropodomorpha and Theropoda) and to define the phylogenetic position of the basal members of the group. The most parsimonious hypothesis has Silesaurus opolensis as the sister taxon to a dichotomy including monophyletic Saurischia and Ornithischia. The latter includes Pisanosaurus mertii, and the former all other well-known Triassic dinosaurs. Saurischia is composed of two major monophyletic groups: Herrerasauridae (including Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis and Staurikosaurus pricei) and Eusaurischia (including the theropod and sauropodomorph lineages), while Eoraptor lunensis appears to represent the sister taxon to Eusaurischia. Saturnalia tupiniquim is a stem-taxon to Sauropodomorpha and Guaibasaurus candelariensis might belong to the theropod branch. Some of these hypotheses are, however, not strongly supported. Especially uncertain are the affinities of Silesaurus and Guaibasaurus. The latter can only be safely regarded as a saurischian, while the former might belong to the ornithischian lineage. The dinosaurian affinities of Eoraptor and Herrerasauridae are strongly supported. Yet, the possibility that they (especially Eoraptor) represent basal theropods, rather than basal saurischians, cannot be dismissed. In fact, basal saurischian evolution is still too poorly understood for a definitive hypothesis of relationships to be presented.}},

The most enigmatic of the saurischian taxa is, however, Guaibasaurus candelariensis, previously regarded as either a basal theropod or a basal sauropodomorph. This study provides a detailed anatomical revision of all specimens originally referred to G. candelariensis by Bonaparte and co-authors, including its type-series and a more recently excavated partial postcranium. Although coming from different sites, these specimens share a unique combination of traits, and at least one possible autapomorphic feature of the pelvis, which support the inclusivity and uniqueness of the species. G. candelariensis was a medium-sized (nearly 2 m long) biped with an intriguing mix of plesiomorphic and derived (eusaurischian/theropod) features. Phylogenetic studies reveal weak support for the nesting of G. candelariensis within Theropoda, but this affinity is bolstered by various traits it shares with neotheropods. The Norian age of G. candelariensis corroborates previous studies that suggest the continuous radiation of more basal dinosauromorphs until the end of the Triassic, after the appearance of the three main dinosaur clades.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Silesauridae is an exclusively Triassic group of dinosauromorphs, knowledge on the diversity of which has increased dramatically in the last few years. Silesaurid relationships are still contentious, as a result in part of different homology statements, particularly regarding the typical edentulous mandible tip of these animals. One of the most complete silesaurids yet discovered is Sacisaurus agudoensis from the Caturrita Formation (Late Triassic: Norian) of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, represented by numerous isolated bones recovered from a single site. The anatomy of S. agudoensis is fully described for the first time here, and comparisons are provided to other basal dinosauromorphs. S. agudoensis is a small-bodied animal (less than 1 m in length) that possesses a dentition consisting of leaf-shaped crowns with large denticles in the carinae, a plesiomorphic propubic pelvis with an almost fully closed acetabulum, elongate distal hindlimbs suggesting well-developed cursorial ability, and a laterally projected outer malleolus in the tibia. All previous numerical phylogenies supported a non-dinosaur dinosauromorph affinity for Silesauridae, but the reanalysis of one of those studies suggests that a position within Dinosauria is not unlikely, with silesaurids forming the basal branch of the ornithischian lineage.}},

Such trees more accurately represent the results of a study than do current tree-generating algorithms that obscure areas of uncertainty. The approach is a simple modification of existing tree-generating methods. As an illustration, a biochemical data set is analyzed using this technique.}},

Phylogenetic analysis of a diverse array of crocodylomorph taxa found strong support for a clade comprising H. rebouli, Peirosauridae, and Sebecus. The name Sebecia nom. nov. is proposed for this grouping, which is diagnosed by numerous characters, including the participation of the quadratojugal in the mandibular condyle. The distribution of this diverse and long-lived clade lends further support to the biogeographical hypothesis that faunal connections existed between Africa and South America well into mid-Cretaceous times. {\copyright} 2007 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2007, 149, 533–567.}},

S. phuphokensis is distinguished from the other broad-snouted goniopholidids on the basis of the following characters: penetration of the nasals in the narial border; presence of a robust and high median ridge on the interorbital surface; lateral margin of the frontal forming the medial edge of the orbit; supraoccipital exhibiting a wide pentagonal shape. A phylogenetic analysis using 101 characters for 29 mesoeucrocodylian taxa and 3 outgroup taxa supports the monophyly of the family Goniopholididae. In addition, the Thai specimen forms a clade with the European Goniopholis. Based on our strict consensus tree, the generic name Goniopholis should be restricted to the European forms only.}},

A cladistic analysis indicates that Tulerpeton is a reptiliomorph stem-group amniote and the earliest known crown-group tetrapod: Acanthostega and Ichthyostega are successively more derived plesion stem-group tetrapods and do not consititute a monophyletic ichthyostegalian radiation. Previous analyses suggesting a profound split in tetrapod phylogeny are thereby corroborated, and likewise the interpretation of Westlothiana as a stem-group amniote. The divergence of reptiliomorphs from batrachomorphs occurred before the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary. Tulerpeton originates from an entirely aquatic environment with a diverse fish fauna. The morphologies of its limbs and those of Devonian stem-tetrapods suggest that dactyly predates the elaboration of the carpus and tarsus, and that Polydactyly persisted after the evolutionary divergence of the principal lineages of living tetrapods. The apparent absence of a branchial lamina and gill skeleton suggests that Tulerpeton was primarily air-breathing, whereas contemporary stem-group tetrapods and more recent batrachomorphs retained greater emphasis on gill-breathing.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Most previous phylogenetic analyses of squamates ('lizards' and snakes) employing large character sets have focused on osteology. Soft anatomical traits bearing on this problem have usually been considered in small subsets. Here, a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of squamate soft anatomy is attempted. 126 informative characters are assessed for 23 squamate lineages, representing snakes, amphisbaenians, dibamids, and all the traditionally recognized 'families' of lizards. The traditionally recognized groupings Iguania, Scleroglossa, Gekkota, Scincomorpha, Anguimorpha and Varanoidea are corroborated in this analysis. More controversial taxa are resolved as follows. Xantusiids, amphisbaenians and dibamids cluster with gekkotans, and snakes are strongly allied with anguimorphs in general, and varanids in particular. Nearly all these clades are congruent with those found in a recent comprehensive osteological analysis; the strong support for snake-varanid relationships found in both studies is particularly notable. This congruence is surprising given that previous studies of soft anatomy tended to give differing and often heterodox results. These previous results can be attributed to overrepresentation of misleading characters in small isolated data sets. Such misleading signals are minimized when data sets are combined. For instance, the snake-varanid clade is contradicted by many characters, and analyses of particular organ systems therefore give differing results. However, characters that are incongruent with the snake-varanid clade also disagree with each other (diffuse homoplasy), rather than forming coherent support for some particular alternative clade (concerted homoplasy). In a combined analysis these incongruent but diffuse characters cancel each other out to leave a very strong (and orthodox) phylogenetic signal. These results underscore the view that the raw amount of homoplasy — as revealed by consistency and retention indices — is not the only determinant of phylogenetic signal; the distribution of that homoplasy is also important. Thus, questioning a phylogenetic hypothesis (e.g. the snake-varanid clade) by identifying numerous conflicting characters is insufficient — the structure of the conflicting characters should be assessed in a rigorous phylogenetic analysis.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The widespread view that Archaeopteryx was a primitive (basal) bird has been recently challenged by a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis that placed Archaeopteryx with deinonychosaurian theropods. The new phylogeny suggested that typical bird flight (powered by the front limbs only) either evolved at least twice, or was lost/modified in some deinonychosaurs. However, this parsimony-based result was acknowledged to be weakly supported. Maximum-likelihood and related Bayesian methods applied to the same dataset yield a different and more orthodox result: Archaeopteryx is restored as a basal bird with bootstrap frequency of 73 per cent and posterior probability of 1. These results are consistent with a single origin of typical (forelimb-powered) bird flight. The Archaeopteryx–deinonychosaur clade retrieved by parsimony is supported by more characters (which are on average more homoplasious), whereas the Archaeopteryx–bird clade retrieved by likelihood-based methods is supported by fewer characters (but on average less homoplasious). Both positions for Archaeopteryx remain plausible, highlighting the hazy boundary between birds and advanced theropods. These results also suggest that likelihood-based methods (in addition to parsimony) can be useful in morphological phylogenetics.}},

It represents the first ceratopsian dinosaur in the Korean peninsula and is assigned to Koreaceratops hwaseongensis gen. et sp. nov. Autapomorphies of Koreaceratops include very tall neural spines over five times higher than the associated centra in the distal caudals, and a unique astragalus divided into two fossae by a prominent craniocaudal ridge on the proximal surface. A phylogenetic analysis indicates that Koreaceratops is positioned between Archaeoceratops and all more derived neoceratopsians, and the elongation of caudal neural spines was an important derived character in non-ceratopsid neoceratopsians. The very tall caudal neural spines in Koreaceratops, Montanoceratops, Udanoceratops, Protoceratops, and Bagaceratops appear to be homoplasious, suggesting an independent adaptation, possibly for swimming. Skeletal evidence suggests that obligate quadrupedalism occurred gradually in neoceratopsians progressing from bipedal through facultative quadrupedalism, to complete quadrupedalism in Coronosauria.}},

Comparative morphological analysis suggests that: 1) Lagynocystida are digital-bearing mitrates; 2) Peltocystida are glossal-bearing mitrates; 3) in Mitrocystitida, glossal and digital are incorporated into a closed marginal thecal frame or modified into articulated posterior spines (Anomalocystitidae); 4) Ovocarpus? circularis is synonymized with O. moncereti; 5) Chauvelia discoidalis and Mitrocystites riadanensis are both assigned to the genus Aspidocarpus; 6) Mitrocystella barrandei is assigned to the new genus Promitrocystites. The original reconstruction of Vizcainocarpus dentiger proposed by Ruta, (1997a) is modified, as a result of the identification of two additional plates in the posterior portion of the theca. The new species Vizcainocarpus rutai from the Tremadoc (Lower Ordovician) of Shropshire (England) is described and represents the oldest record of mitrocystitidan mitrates. V. rutai differs from V. dentiger in the relatively broader size of its zygal and marginals and in the presence, on the lower thecal surface, of a peripheral fringe of fibrillar stereom. A cladistic analysis of selected stylophoran taxa based on the proposed plate homologies indicates that: 1) cornutes and mitrates are sister-groups, both deriving from a Ceratocystis-like ancestor; 2) Peltocystida and Mitrocystitida are sister-groups; 3) Lagynocystida is sister-group of (Peltocystida + Mitrocystitida); 4) Lobocarpus is not a cornute but a primitive Cambrian mitrate belonging either to the stem-group of Mitrocystitida or to the stem-group of (Peltocystida + Mitrocystitida); 5) Anomalocystitidae represents a family of the suborder Mitrocystitida.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Evolutionary relationships between the Echinoconchidae, Productidae, Buxtoniinae, and Juresaniinae (Phylum Brachiopoda, Order Productida) have been the subject of debate for the better part of a century. The original (Muir-Wood and Williams, 1965) and revised (Brunton et al., 2000) Brachiopoda volumes of the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology use markedly different classifications and emphasize different characters. The 1965 Treatise classification for these taxa primarily was based on internal features, especially the cardinal process; the revised Treatise (2000) relied on external ornament and shell shape. Multiple phylogenetic analyses (global parsimony, stratocladistics, nearest-neighbor) of 14 genera, representing all of the relevant subfamilies and outgroups, are in strong agreement that 1) the subfamily Buxtoniinae belongs in the family Echinoconchidae, not to the Productidae; 2) the subfamily Juresaniinae is more closely related to the Echinoconchinae than to the Buxtoniinae; and 3) that internal characters, such as a shafted cardinal process and anterio-medial position of the brachial valve adductor field, provide the best phylogenetic signal, and are synapomorphic for the Echinoconchidae. Jackknifing and Bremer Support corroborate these results. 10.1666/0022-3360(2002)076<0659:EIVECP>2.0.CO;2}},

It further emphasizes the close faunal affinities between the Eastern and Western Tethyan realm. The new taxon is convergent on cyamodontoid placodonts in having developed a dorsal body armor composed of small osteoderms. The underlying ribs are transversely broadened so as to establish contact along their length, thus forming a closed dorsal ?rib basket,? a unique morphology shared with Saurosphargis.}},

Others that may also reflect aquatic adaptations include platelike scapula and coracoid, elongate neck with extremely long and slender ribs, and reduction of osteoderms. In contrast, its pelvic girdle and hind limb have no aquatic modifications. Anatomic features, taphonomy, and local geological data suggest that it may have lived in a coastal–island environment. This lifestyle, convergent with some Jurassic marine crocodyliforms that lived at least 40 million years later and the saltwater species of extant Crocodylus, contradicts with the prevailing view that Triassic archosaurians were restricted to nonmarine ecosystems. Its mosaic anatomy represents a previously unknown ecomorph within primitive archosaurians.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The fossil record of tyrannosauroid theropods is marked by a substantial temporal and morphological gap between small-bodied, Barremian taxa, and extremely large-bodied taxa from the latest Cretaceous. Here we describe a new tyrannosauroid, Xiongguanlong baimoensis n. gen. et sp., from the Aptian–Albian Xinminpu Group of western China that represents a phylogenetic, morphological, and temporal link between these disjunct portions of tyrannosauroid evolutionary history. Xiongguanlong is recovered in our phylogenetic analysis as the sister taxon to Tyrannosauridae plus Appalachiosaurus, and marks the appearance of several tyrannosaurid hallmark features, including a sharp parietal sagittal crest, a boxy basicranium, a quadratojugal with a flaring dorsal process and a flexed caudal edge, premaxillary teeth bearing a median lingual ridge, and an expanded axial neural spine surmounted by distinct processes at its corners. Xiongguanlong is characterized by a narrow and elongate muzzle resembling that of Alioramus. The slender, unornamented nasals of Xiongguanlong are inconsistent with recent hypotheses of correlated progression in tyrannosauroid feeding mechanics, and suggest more complex patterns of character evolution in the integration of feeding adaptations in tyrannosaurids. Body mass estimates for the full-grown holotype specimen of Xiongguanlong fall between those of Late Cretaceous tyrannosaurids and Barremian tyrannosauroids, suggesting that the trend of increasing body size observed in North American Late Cretaceous Tyrannosauridae may extend through the Cretaceous history of Tyrannosauroidea though further phylogenetic work is required to corroborate this.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract Phylogenetic analysis was used to evaluate evolutionary relationships within the Cambrian suborder Olenellina Walcott, 1890; special emphasis was placed on those taxa outside of the Olenelloidea. Fifty-seven exoskeletal characters were coded for 24 taxa within the Olenellina and two outgroups referable to the ?fallotaspidoid? grade. The Olenelloidea, along with the genus Gabriellus Fritz, 1992, are the sister group of the Judomioidea Repina, 1979. The ?Nevadioidea? Hup\'{e}, 1953 are a paraphyletic grade group. Four new genera are recognized, Plesionevadia, Cambroinyoella, Callavalonia, and Sdzuyomia, and three new species are described, Nevadia fritzi, Cirquella nelsoni, and Cambroinyoella wallacei. Phylogenetic parsimony analysis is also used to make predictions about the ancestral morphology of the Olenellina. This morphology most resembles the morphology found in Plesionevadia and Pseudojudomia Egorova in Goryanskii and Egorova, 1964.}},

A new species of the genus Microbunodon (Anthracotheriidae, Artiodactyla) from the Miocene of Pakistan: genus revision, phylogenetic relationships and palaeobiogeography. — Zoologica Scripta, 33, 97–115. New unpublished remains of small Anthracotheriinae are described. First, materials from the upper Oligocene (MP 30) locality of La Milloque, southwest France, permit a review of the species Microbunodon minimum. Thereafter, fossils from the middle and late Miocene of the Potwar Plateau, Pakistan are attributed to the European genus Microbunodon. Microbunodon milaensis sp. n. from the Nagri Formation (between 10.3 and 9.2 Ma), Pakistan, is described and the species M. silistrensis from the Lower Manchar Formation (between 16 and 15 Ma) and from the Chinji Formation (between 12.7 and 11.5 Ma), Pakistan, is reviewed. The new species represents the last occurrence of the subfamily Anthracotheriinae, around 9.3 Ma. Similar materials from the Bugti and Siwalik Hills were previously considered as a small Anthracotherium. Comparisons with M. minimum from the European late Oligocene lead to a complete revision of the genus and permit definition of a new set of characters, which separate Microbunodon from Anthracotherium. A cladistic analysis reconsiders phylogenetic relationships among Anthracotheriinae, separating an Anthracothema–Anthracotherium clade and an Anthracokeryx–Microbunodon clade. Microbunodon appears to stem from the Asian late Eocene–lower Oligocene genus Anthracokeryx. These results imply a new distribution of the genus Microbunodon showing exchanges between Europe and Asia during the late Oligocene and probably the lower Miocene.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;The phylogeny of Eucynodontia is an important topic in vertebrate paleontology and is the foundation for understanding the origin of mammals. However, consensus on the phylogeny of Eucynodontia remains elusive. To clarify their interrelationships, a cladistic analysis, based on 145 characters and 31 species, and intergrating most prior works, was performed. The monophyly of Eucynodontia is confirmed, although the results slightly differ from those of previous analyses with respect to the composition of both Cynognathia and Probainognathia. This is also the first numerical cladistic analysis to recover a monophyletic Traversodontidae. Brasilodon is the plesiomorphic sister taxon of Mammalia, although it is younger than the oldest mammals and is specialized in some characters. A monophyletic Prozostrodontia, including tritheledontids, tritylodontids, and mammals, is well supported by many characters. Pruning highly incomplete taxa generally has little effect on the inferred pattern of relationships among the more complete taxa, although exceptions sometimes occur when basal fragmentary taxa are removed. Taxon sampling of the current data matrix shows that taxon sampling was poor in some previous studies, implying that their results are not reliable. Two major unresolved questions in cynodont phylogenetics are whether tritylodontids are more closely related to mammals or to traversodontids, and whether tritylodontids or tritheledontids are closer to mammals. Analyses of possible synapomorphies support a relatively close relationship between mammals and tritylodontids, to the exclusion of traversodontids, but do not clearly indicate whether or not tritheledontids are closer to mammals than are tritylodontids.}},

Keichousaurus and Dianopachysaurus form the monophyletic Keichousauridae that is the sister group of all European pachypleurosaurs. Our cladistic analysis also supports a previously proposed paleobiogeographic hypothesis of an eastern Tethyan origin of pachypleurosaurs and their migration into the western Tethyan faunal province. The existence of a long ghost lineage as required by the paleobiogeographic hypothesis is greatly shortened by the discovery of Dianopachysaurus.}},

  Abstract                 = {{A phylogenetic analysis of 123 morphological characters of basal waterfowl (Aves: Anseriformes) and other selected avian orders confirmed that the screamers (Anhimae: Anhitn-idae) are the sister-group of other waterfowl (Anseres), and that the magpie goose (Anseranatidae: Anseranas semipalmata) is the sister group of other modern waterfowl exclusive of screamers (Anatidae sensu stricto). The analysis also supports the traditional hypothesis of the gallinaceous birds (Galliformes) as the sister group of the Anseriformes. Presbyornis, a fossil from the early Eocene of Wyoming and averred by Olson \& Feduccia as showing that the Anseriformes were derived from shorebirds (Charadriiformes), was found to represent the sister group of the Anatidae. Associated hypotheses by Olson \& Feduccia concerning the implications of Presbyornis for the phylogenetic relationships of flamingos (Phoenicopteriformes), the position of the Anhimidae within the waterfowl, relationships among modern Anatidae, and a plausible evolutionary scenario for waterfowl also are rejected. Analyses revealed that cranial characters were critical to the establishment of the Galliformes as the sister group of the Anseriformes; exclusion of the Anhimidae, especially in combination with Anseranas, also undermined the support for this inference. Placement of Presbyornis as the sister group of the Anatidae casts doubt on the role suggested by Feduccia of 'transitional shorebirds' in the origin of modern avian orders, and calls into question the concept of 'fossil mosaics'. The phylogenetic hypothesis is used to reconstruct an evolutionary scenario for selected ecomorphological characters in the galliform-anseriform transition, to predict the most parsimonious states of these characters for Presbyornis, and to propose a phylogenetic classification of the higher-order taxa of waterfowl. This re-examination of Presbyornis also is used to exemplify the fundamental methodological shortcomings of the intuitive approach to the reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships.}},

  Abstract                 = {{In recent years, avian systematics has been characterized by a diminished reliance on morphological cladistics of modern taxa, intensive palaeornithogical research stimulated by new discoveries and an inundation by analyses based on DNA sequences. Unfortunately, in contrast to significant insights into basal origins, the broad picture of neornithine phylogeny remains largely unresolved. Morphological studies have emphasized characters of use in palaeontological contexts. Molecular studies, following disillusionment with the pioneering, but non-cladistic, work of Sibley and Ahlquist, have differed markedly from each other and from morphological works in both methods and findings. Consequently, at the turn of the millennium, points of robust agreement among schools concerning higher-order neornithine phylogeny have been limited to the two basalmost and several mid-level, primary groups. This paper describes a phylogenetic (cladistic) analysis of 150 taxa of Neornithes, including exemplars from all non-passeriform families, and subordinal representatives of Passeriformes. Thirty-five outgroup taxa encompassing Crocodylia, predominately theropod Dinosauria, and selected Mesozoic birds were used to root the trees. Based on study of specimens and the literature, 2954 morphological characters were defined; these characters have been described in a companion work, approximately one-third of which were multistate (i.e. comprised at least three states), and states within more than one-half of these multistate characters were ordered for analysis. Complete heuristic searches using 10 000 random-addition replicates recovered a total solution set of 97 well-resolved, most-parsimonious trees (MPTs). The set of MPTs was confirmed by an expanded heuristic search based on 10 000 random-addition replicates and a full ratchet-augmented exploration to ascertain global optima. A strict consensus tree of MPTs included only six trichotomies, i.e. nodes differing topologically among MPTs. Bootstrapping (based on 10 000 replicates) percentages and ratchet-minimized support (Bremer) indices indicated most nodes to be robust. Several fossil Neornithes (e.g. Dinornithiformes, Aepyornithiformes) were placed within the ingroup a posteriori either through unconstrained, heursitic searches based on the complete matrix augmented by these taxa separately or using backbone-constraints. Analysis confirmed the topology among outgroup Theropoda and achieved robust resolution at virtually all levels of the Neornithes. Findings included monophyly of the palaeognathous birds, comprising the sister taxa Tinamiformes and ratites, respectively, and the Anseriformes and Galliformes as monophyletic sister-groups, together forming the sister-group to other Neornithes exclusive of the Palaeognathae (Neoaves). Noteworthy inferences include: (i) the sister-group to remaining Neoaves comprises a diversity of marine and wading birds; (ii) Podicipedidae are the sister-group of Gaviidae, and not closely related to the Phoenicopteridae, as recently suggested; (iii) the traditional Pelecaniformes, including the shoebill (Balaeniceps rex) as sister-taxon to other members, are monophyletic; (iv) traditional Ciconiiformes are monophyletic; (v) Strigiformes and Falconiformes are sister-groups; (vi) Cathartidae is the sister-group of the remaining Falconiformes; (vii) Ralliformes (Rallidae and Heliornithidae) are the sister-group to the monophyletic Charadriiformes, with the traditionally composed Gruiformes and Turniciformes (Turnicidae and Mesitornithidae) sequentially paraphyletic to the entire foregoing clade; (viii) Opisthocomus hoazin is the sister-taxon to the Cuculiformes (including the Musophagidae); (ix) traditional Caprimulgiformes are monophyletic and the sister-group of the Apodiformes; (x) Trogoniformes are the sister-group of Coliiformes; (xi) Coraciiformes, Piciformes and Passeriformes are mutually monophyletic and closely related; and (xii) the Galbulae are retained within the Piciformes. Unresolved portions of the Neornithes (nodes having more than one most-parsimonious solution) comprised three parts of the tree: (a) several interfamilial nodes within the Charadriiformes; (b) a trichotomy comprising the (i) Psittaciformes, (ii) Columbiformes and (iii) Trogonomorphae (Trogoniformes, Coliiformes) + Passerimorphae (Coraciiformes, Piciformes, Passeriformes); and (c) a trichotomy comprising the Coraciiformes, Piciformes and Passeriformes. The remaining polytomies were among outgroups, although several of the highest-order nodes were only marginally supported; however, the majority of nodes were resolved and met or surpassed conventional standards of support. Quantitative comparisons with alternative hypotheses, examination of highly supportive and diagnostic characters for higher taxa, correspondences with prior studies, complementarity and philosophical differences with palaeontological phylogenetics, promises and challenges of palaeogeography and calibration of evolutionary rates of birds, and classes of promising evidence and future directions of study are reviewed. Homology, as applied to avian examples of apparent homologues, is considered in terms of recent theory, and a revised annotated classification of higher-order taxa of Neornithes and other closely related Theropoda is proposed. {\copyright} 2007 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2007, 149, 1–95.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Quantifying rates of morphological evolution is important in many macroevolutionary studies, and critical when assessing possible adaptive radiations and episodes of punctuated equilibrium in the fossil record. However, studies of morphological rates of change have lagged behind those on taxonomic diversification, and most authors have focused on continuous characters and quantifying patterns of morphological rates over time. Here, we provide a phylogenetic approach, using discrete characters and three statistical tests to determine points on a cladogram (branches or entire clades) that are characterized by significantly high or low rates of change. These methods include a randomization approach that identifies branches with significantly high rates and likelihood ratio tests that pinpoint either branches or clades that have significantly higher or lower rates than the pooled rate of the remainder of the tree. As a test case for these methods, we analyze a discrete character dataset of lungfish, which have long been regarded as ” living fossils” due to an apparent slowdown in rates since the Devonian. We find that morphological rates are highly heterogeneous across the phylogeny and recover a general pattern of decreasing rates along the phylogenetic backbone toward living taxa, from the Devonian until the present. Compared with previous work, we are able to report a more nuanced picture of lungfish evolution using these new methods.}},

Gnetales and Angiosperms are supported as sister groups of theAnaspermae. A sister-group relationship between Coniferales and Ginkgoales represents a paraphyletic group, because Coniferales and Anaspermae share a common ancestry (Mesospermae). Ginkgoales and Mesospermae are sister groups of theCladospermae. Cycadales are supported as the most archaic Spermatophyta.A posteriori consideration of fossil taxa supports the conclusion that data from the fossil record are useful for confirming plesiomorphies of extant taxa. Fossil taxa with apomorphic character states are discussed as biasing for superficial accelerated transformations, which are probably unacceptable from the standpoint of morphological homology.}},

A phylogenetic analysis based on dermal skeletal features of Devonian actinopterygians indicates that Donnrosenia gen. nov. is the sister taxon to Howqualepis from the Middle Devonian of Victoria, Australia, and is embedded within a possible clade containing the actinopterygians from the Gogo Formation, Western Australia.

Here we present new observations from the most complete, acid-prepared Devonian tetrapodomorph fish yet discovered, Gogonasus1, 2, which was previously placed just crownward of Kenichthys and rhizodontids3, 4, the most primitive taxa on the tetrapod lineage. Unexpectedly, Gogonasus shows a mosaic of plesiomorphic and derived tetrapod-like features. Whereas the braincase and dermal cranial skeleton exhibit generalized morphologies with respect to Eusthenopteron5 or Panderichthys6, taxa that are traditionally considered to be phyletically close to tetrapods7, 8, the presence of a deeply invaginated, wide spiracle, advanced internal spiracular architecture and near-horizontal hyomandibula are specialized features that are absent from Eusthenopteron9. Furthermore, the pectoral fin skeleton of Gogonasus shares several features with that of Tiktaalik, the most tetrapod-like fish10. A new phylogenetic analysis places Gogonasus crownward of Eusthenopteron as the sister taxon to the Elpistostegalia. Aspects of the basic tetrapod limb skeleton and middle ear architecture can now be traced further back within the tetrapodomorph radiation.}},

This paper reports on previously undescribed ceratopsian remains from the middle Campanian beds of the Judith River Formation of Montana, which represent the oldest known chasmosaurine. The Judith River chasmosaur shows a combination of characters not seen in any previously described ceratopsid. The parietal has a broad median bar, a rounded caudal margin, and highly reduced epiparietals. Episquamosals are enlarged anteriorly but decrease in size posteriorly, and imbricate as in centrosaurines. The postorbital horns are moderately elongate, inclined anterolaterally, and have an unusual teardrop-shaped cross section. The unique combination of characters seen in the Judith River chasmosaurine precludes referral to any previously known genus, and it is therefore described as a new genus and species, Judiceratops tigris. The addition of Judiceratops to the dinosaurian fauna of North America underscores the diversity of horned dinosaurs in the Late Cretaceous, which results from a combination of high diversity within faunas, a high degree of endemism, and rapid faunal turnover.}},

The origins of these giant ceratopsids, the Triceratopsini, are poorly understood. This paper describes Titanoceratops ouranos, a giant ceratopsid from the late Campanian (73–74 Ma) of New Mexico, and the earliest known triceratopsin. The holotype was previously interpreted as an aberrant and exceptionally large specimen of Pentaceratops sternbergi, but the animal does not show the diagnostic features of Pentaceratops. Instead, cladistic analysis shows that Titanoceratops is the sister taxon of a clade formed by Eotriceratops, Triceratops, and Torosaurus. With an estimated mass of 6.5 tons, Titanoceratops is among the largest dinosaurs known from the Campanian of North America, and rivaled Triceratops in size. The recognition of Titanoceratops suggests that giant chasmosaurines evolved once, among the Triceratopsini, and that the group evolved large size five million years earlier than previously thought. The giant horned dinosaurs probably originated in the southern part of the North American continent during the Campanian but only became widespread during the Maastrichtian.}},

Mojoceratops perifania is represented by a skull and a parietal from the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta and an isolated parietal from the Dinosaur Park Formation of Saskatchewan. Several other specimens are provisionally referred to this taxon. While Mojoceratops shares many plesiomorphies with Chasmosaurus, the animal lacks the forward-curving parietal epoccipitals and reduced postorbital horns that diagnose the genus Chasmosaurus, and it differs from all other chasmosaurines in exhibiting a prominent sulcus on the anterior margin of the parietal, swellings on the anterodorsal surface of the parietal rami, and a small accessory process on the first parietal epoccipital. Other unusual features include anteriorly extended parietal fenestrae, a broad, heart-shaped frill, and transverse expansion of the postfrontal fontanelle. The type material of ?Eoceratops canadensis? and ?Chasmosaurus kaiseni? are nondiagnostic and these names are therefore considered nomina dubia, but their morphology is consistent with Mojoceratops and they probably belong to this genus. The frill of Mojoceratops shows marked variation. Some of this variation probably results from intraspecific variation or ontogenetic changes, but because the Dinosaur Park Formation encompasses more than a million years of time, evolution may explain some of these differences. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Mojoceratops forms a clade with Agujaceratops mariscalensis; Chasmosaurus is the most basal member of Chasmosaurinae.}},

Here, we describe caenagnathid fossils from the late Campanian Aguja Formation of West Texas, and revise the systematics of caenagnathids from the Campanian of North America. Caenagnathids from the late Campanian of Canada represent three species in three genera: Caenagnathus collinsi, Chirostenotes pergracilis and Leptorhynchos elegans gen. nov. Leptorhynchos is diagnosed by its small size, its short, deep mandible, and the upturned tip of the beak. A single caenagnathid is known from the late Campanian of Utah, Hagryphus giganteus. Two caenagnathid species occur in the Aguja Formation, ?Chirostenotes sp. and Leptorhynchos gaddisi sp. nov. L. gaddisi differs from L. elegans in that the tip of the beak is narrower and less upturned. Phylogenetic analysis recovers Caenagnathidae and Oviraptoridae as monophyletic sister taxa. Within Caenagnathidae, the North American species seem to form a monophyletic assemblage, the Caenagnathinae, within which Chirostenotes and Caenagnathus form a clade to the exclusion of Leptorhynchos. The discovery of Chirostenotes gaddisi provides more evidence for the existence of a distinct dinosaurian fauna in southern North America during the Campanian. Furthermore, the Aguja fossils show that caenagnathids were widespread and highly diverse in the Late Cretaceous of North America. This diversity was maintained in two ways. First, variation in body size and beak shape suggests that diversity within formations is maintained by niche partitioning, in a way analogous to Darwin's finches. Second, diversity is maintained by high degree of endemism, with different species of caenagnathids occurring in different habitats.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The Cretaceous–Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary is marked by a major mass extinction, yet this event is thought to have had little effect on the diversity of lizards and snakes (Squamata). A revision of fossil squamates from the Maastrichtian and Paleocene of North America shows that lizards and snakes suffered a devastating mass extinction coinciding with the Chicxulub asteroid impact. Species-level extinction was 83\%, and the K-Pg event resulted in the elimination of many lizard groups and a dramatic decrease in morphological disparity. Survival was associated with small body size and perhaps large geographic range. The recovery was prolonged; diversity did not approach Cretaceous levels until 10 My after the extinction, and resulted in a dramatic change in faunal composition. The squamate fossil record shows that the end-Cretaceous mass extinction was far more severe than previously believed, and underscores the role played by mass extinctions in driving diversification.}},

  Abstract                 = {{A new alvarezsaur, Albertonykus borealis, is described from the Lower Maastrichtian of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, Alberta, Canada. Forelimb and hindlimb elements from at least two individuals were recovered from the Albertosaurus bonebed at Dry Island Provincial Park, along with pedal phalanges from nearby localities. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Albertonykus is the sister taxon of the Asian clade Mononykinae, consistent with the hypothesis that the alvarezsaurs originated in South America, and then dispersed to Asia via North America. The discovery of Albertonykus provides important insights into the biology of the Alvarezsauridae. As in other alvarezsaurs, the forelimbs of Albertonykus are specialized for digging, but they are too short to permit burrowing; they were most likely used to dig into insect nests. Potential prey items are evaluated in light of the fossil record of social insects. Ants were a minor part of the ecosystem during the Cretaceous, and mound-building termites do not appear until the Eocene. This leaves the possibility that Albertonykus preyed on wood-nesting termites. We tested this hypothesis by examining silicified wood from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. It was found that this wood frequently contains borings, which resemble the galleries of dampwood termites (Termopsidae).}},

Associated skeletons of small dinosaurs are exceedingly rare, and small (<10 kg) carnivorous theropods have not previously been reported from these beds. Here, we describe a small dromaeosaurid from the 75-million-year-old Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, Canada. Hesperonychus elizabethae gen. et sp. nov. is represented by a pelvic girdle from an animal weighing ≈1,900 g. Despite its size, the pubes and ilia are coossified, indicating that the animal was somatically mature. This is the smallest carnivorous, nonavian dinosaur known from North America. Phylogenetic analysis of Hesperonychus reveals that it is not closely related to previously described North American dromaeosaurids. Instead, Hesperonychus is a member of the dromaeosaurid clade Microraptorinae, a group containing the 4-winged Microraptor and the feathered Sinornithosaurus, both from the Lower Cretaceous Jehol Group of China. Hesperonychus is the youngest known member of this lineage, extending the temporal range of the clade by 45 million years, and it is the first microraptorine known from North America, providing further evidence for an affinity between the dinosaur faunas of North America and Asia. Study of fossil collections from the Dinosaur Park and Oldman formations of Alberta has revealed numerous isolated bones of small, basal dromaeosaurids, which are tentatively referred to Hesperonychus. These fossils suggest that small dromaeosaurids were a significant component of the carnivore community in this Late Cretaceous biota.}},

Machairasaurus leptonychus, gen. et sp. nov. is diagnosed by slender, weakly curved manual unguals, reduced flexor tubercles, penultimate phalanges that are subequal in length to the preceding phalanges, and short, robust manual digits. Machairasaurus is found to be a member of the Ingeniinae, along with Ingenia yanshini, Heyuannia huangi, Conchoraptor gracilis, and Nemegtomaia barsboldi. Machairasaurus exhibits unusual proportions of the manus, suggesting that the manus was not primarily used to grasp prey. Instead, Machairasaurus and other oviraptorids are likely to have fed largely on plant material. The recognition of a previously unknown oviraptorid at Bayan Mandahu provides further evidence that the Bayan Mandahu dinosaur assemblage is distinct from that found at the Djadokhta Formation exposures at Bayn Dzak, Tugriken Shireh, and Ukhaa Tolgod. Given that these localities are separated by just a few hundred kilometres and represent similar palaeoenvironments, marked differences in the fauna suggest that the Bayan Mandahu Formation of Inner Mongolia is not coeval with the known Djadokhta localities in Mongolia.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Recent work in the Campanian Aguja Formation of Big Bend, Texas, has resulted in the recovery of two frontoparietal domes from a new genus of pachycephalosaur. Texacephale langstoni gen. et sp. nov. is diagnosed by a tall, arched nasal boss, flange-like processes articulating the dome with the peripheral elements, and a low pedicel separating the cerebral fossa from the skull roof. The skull dome is composed largely of the fused frontals and parietals, with limited participation of the peripheral elements, and the supratemporal fenestrae remain open. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Texacephale langstoni is a basal member of the Pachycephalosauria. The discovery of Texacephale supports previous suggestions that the dinosaur fauna of Texas was distinct from that of contemporary assemblages to the north. The phylogenetic analysis presented here indicates that the Asian pachycephalosaurs form a monophyletic group, deeply nested within the Pachycephalosauridae, and that the basal members of the group are all North American. This finding indicates that pachycephalosaurids originated in North America, rather than Asia, as previously believed. The high diversity of North American pachycephalosaurs and the late appearance of pachycephalosaurs in Asia are consistent with this hypothesis. The biology of Texacephale and other Pachycephalosauridae are also discussed. The morphology of the dome in Texacephale and other pachycephalosaurs supports the hypothesis that pachycephalosaurids engaged in intraspecific combat, while the occurrence of Texacephale and other pachycephalosaurs in nearshore deposits argues that the pachycephalosaurs were not restricted to inland habitats.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The effect of the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) (formerly Cretaceous–Tertiary, K–T) mass extinction on avian evolution is debated, primarily because of the poor fossil record of Late Cretaceous birds. In particular, it remains unclear whether archaic birds became extinct gradually over the course of the Cretaceous or whether they remained diverse up to the end of the Cretaceous and perished in the K–Pg mass extinction. Here, we describe a diverse avifauna from the latest Maastrichtian of western North America, which provides definitive evidence for the persistence of a range of archaic birds to within 300,000 y of the K–Pg boundary. A total of 17 species are identified, including 7 species of archaic bird, representing Enantiornithes, Ichthyornithes, Hesperornithes, and an Apsaravis-like bird. None of these groups are known to survive into the Paleogene, and their persistence into the latest Maastrichtian therefore provides strong evidence for a mass extinction of archaic birds coinciding with the Chicxulub asteroid impact. Most of the birds described here represent advanced ornithurines, showing that a major radiation of Ornithurae preceded the end of the Cretaceous, but none can be definitively referred to the Neornithes. This avifauna is the most diverse known from the Late Cretaceous, and although size disparity is lower than in modern birds, the assemblage includes both smaller forms and some of the largest volant birds known from the Mesozoic, emphasizing the degree to which avian diversification had proceeded by the end of the age of dinosaurs.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract Description of the first varanodontine varanopid material from the highly fossiliferous limestone fissure fill deposits at Richards Spur (Dolese Brothers Limestone Quarry), Oklahoma, is based on elements of at least three individuals recovered from two separate blocks of sedimentary rock. One block, which yielded associated cranial and postcranial bones from both adult and juvenile individuals, includes two well-preserved parabasisphenoid complexes, vertebrae, forelimb, pelvic girdle, and hind limb bones. An isolated maxilla fragment from another block preserves the diagnostic dorsal process characteristic of varanodontines. Preserved cranial and postcranial material is virtually identical to the varanodontine Varanops brevirostris. Taxonomic assessment of this new material in the context of the most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Varanopidae to date indicates the Richards Spur varanodontine is referable to Varanops brevirostris based on distinctive characters of the maxilla and the parabasisphenoid. The large size of Varanops suggests it was one of the top predators of the Richards Spur ecosystem. The Richards Spur locality records the only known co-occurrence of a mycterosaurine and a varanodontine varanopid at a single locality, and varanopids are the most common synapsids in the assemblage. As generally rare components of the more typically preserved lowland environments, the relative abundance and diversity of varanopids at Richards Spur suggests that they may have been more common components of the upland ecosystems in the Early Permian.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The scant fossil record of caecilians has obscured the origin and evolution of this lissamphibian group. Eocaecilia micropodia from the Lower Jurassic of North America remains the only stem-group caecilian with an almost complete skull preserved. However, this taxon has been controversial, engendering re-evaluation of traits considered to be plesiomorphic for extant caecilians. Both the validity of the placement of E. micropodia as a stem caecilian and estimates of the plesiomorphic condition of extant caecilians have been questioned. In order to address these issues, the braincase of E. micropodia was examined via micro-computed tomography. The braincase is considered to be a more reliable phylogenetic indicator than peripheral regions of the skull. These data reveal significant new information, including the possession of an ossified nasal septum, ossified anterior wall of the sphenethmoid, long anterolateral processes on the sphenethmoid, and paired olfactory nerve foramina, which are known only to occur in extant caecilians; the latter are possibly related to the evolution of the tentacle, a caecilian autapomorphy. A phylogenetic analysis that included 64 non-amniote taxa and 308 characters represents the first extensive test of the phylogenetic affinities of E. micropodia. The results place E. micropodia securely on the stem of extant caecilians, representing a clade within Temnospondyli that is the sister taxon to batrachians plus Gerobatrachus. Ancestral character state reconstruction confirms the braincase of E. micropodia to be largely representative of the plesiomorphic condition of extant caecilians. Additionally, the results refine the context within which the evolution of the caecilian form can be evaluated. The robust construction and pattern of the dermal skull of E. micropodia is interpreted as symplesiomorphic with advanced dissorophoid temnospondyls, rather than being autapomorphic in its robust construction. Together these data increase confidence in incorporating E. micropodia into discussions of caecilian evolution.}},

Stegosaurs are known from the Middle Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous; no definitive evidence of the clade is known from younger deposits. New discoveries are improving our understanding of stegosaur biology and showing that stegosaurs were more morphologically diverse than was previously realized. A new phylogeny, which includes all valid stegosaurian taxa, largely agrees with previous studies and shows the European Dacentrurinae was sister taxon to Stegosaurus. Poor resolution at the base of Stegosauria is probably due to the fragmentary nature of many of the Chinese taxa.}},

Although Stegosaurus is one of the most familiar of all dinosaurs, little is known regarding the evolutionary history of this clade.Alpha-level taxonomic revision of all proposed stegosaur taxa shows that 11 species of stegosaur can be regarded as valid on the basis of autapomorphies. These are: Dacentrurus armatus and Loricatosaurus priscus (gen. nov.) from Europe; Kentrosaurus aethiopicus and Paranthodon africanus from Africa; Tuojiangosaurus multispinus, Chungkingosaurus jiangbeiensis, Huayangosaurus taibaii, Gigantspinosaurus sichuanensis and Stegosaurus homheni (comb. nov.) from China; and Stegosaurus mjosi (comb. nov.) and Stegosaurus armatus from North America.A cladistic analysis of Stegosauria (the first to be based upon direct observation of all relevant specimens) is presented, which indicates that Tuojiangosaurus, Loricatosaurus and Paranthodon are sister taxa to Stegosaurus. Stegosaurinae can be defined as all stegosaurs more closely related to Stegosaurus than to Dacentrurus; Stegosauridae is defined as all stegosaurs more closely related to Stegosaurus than to Huayangosaurus; and Huayangosauridae can be defined as all stegosaurs more closely related to Huayangosaurus than to Stegosaurus. This study is also the first phylogenetic analysis to include Gigantspinosaurus, which is recovered as the most basal stegosaur.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Previous descriptions of the postcranial skeleton of the primitive stegosaur Huayangosaurus taibaii (Middle Jurassic: People's Republic of China) are insufficient for character determinations in cladistic analysis. Reexamination of the postcranium has revealed several important characters, most of which are retained plesiomorphies that have not been identified previously. For example, Huayangosaurus retains ossified tendons, the loss of which has been used as a synapomorphy of Stegosauria. These purported stegosaurian synapomorphies now serve to unite the monophyletic clade Stegosauridae, defined as all stegosaurs more closely related to Stegosaurus than to Huayangosaurus. In addition, some anatomical characters previously used as ?ankylosauromorph? synapomorphies have now been identified in Huayangosaurus: this suggests that these characters occur more basally within Thyreophora. The plesiomorphic status of Huayangosaurus suggests that substantial convergence between ankylosaurs and stegosaurs occurred during their respective evolutionary histories, reflecting coincident functional morphological changes associated with the adoption of obligate quadrupedality.}},

The stunning Early Cretaceous diversity of maniraptorans from Liaoning, China1, 2, 3, coupled with a longevity implied by derived Late Jurassic forms such as Archaeopteryx, pushes the origins of maniraptoran lineages back to Pangaean times and engenders the possibility that such lineages existed in Gondwana. A few intriguing, but incomplete, maniraptoran specimens have been reported from South America4, 5, 6, 7, 8, Africa9 and Madagascar10. Their affinities remain contested11, 12, 13, however, and they have been interpreted as biogeographic anomalies relative to other faunal components of these land-masses. Here we describe a near-complete, small dromaeosaurid that is both the most complete and the earliest member of the Maniraptora from South America, and which provides new evidence for a unique Gondwanan lineage of Dromaeosauridae with an origin predating the separation between northern and southern landmasses.}},

Haya is diagnosed by a unique combination of characters, some of which are also present in other Asian Cretaceous basal ornithopods such as a bifid caudal ramus of the jugal and a tapering and beveled predentary. Traits, such as presence of separate maxillary fenestra, otherwise only known in Hypsilophodon, show more homoplastic distributions. Phylogenetic analysis provides weak support for grouping Haya with the Chinese Cretaceous taxa Jeholosaurus and Changchunsaurus, suggesting a greater hidden diversity of such animals in Asia. The most complete prepared specimen of Haya exhibits a sizeable gastrolith mass, representing only the second occurrence among ornithopods.}},

Beishanlong is similar to another Aptian-Albian ornithomimosaur, Harpymimus, with which it shares a phylogenetic position as more derived than the Barremian Shenzhousaurus and as sister to a Late Cretaceous clade composed of Garudimimus and the Ornithomimidae. Beishanlong is one of the largest definitive ornithomimosaurs yet described, though histological analysis shows that the holotype individual was still growing at its death. Together with the co-eval and sympatric therizinosaur Suzhousaurus and the oviraptorosaur Gigantraptor, Beishanlong provides evidence for the parallel evolution of gigantism in separate lineages of beaked and possibly herbivorous coelurosaurs within a short time span in Central Asia.}},

Yamaceratops dorngobiensis, tax. nov., is probably of late Early Cretaceous age, and occupies a phylogenetic position intermediate between Liaoceratops and Archaeoceratops. It is the most basal taxon to display a number of traditional neoceratopsian synapomorphies concentrated in the cheek region and mandible. These include presence of an epijugal, lateral displacement of the coronoid process, a lateral ridge on the surangular for insertion of the jaw adductors, and a lateral wall to the mandibular glenoid. Yamaceratops shares two synapomorphies (tubercles on the ventral edge of the angular and shape of the jugal) with Liaoceratops, indicating that the transient presence of derived characters may be prevalent in the early evolutionary history of Ceratopsia. Yamaceratops shares aspects of frill morphology with Liaoceratops and Leptoceratops that suggest a function unrelated to display for this anatomical structure in basal neoceratopsians, and hints at a more complex evolutionary history for ceratopsian frills. Considerations of patristic distances and mosaic evolution among basal neoceratopsian taxa indicate that a greater diversity of these animals remains undiscovered.}},

Byronosaurus jaffei is included in a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Coelurosauria to ascertain its relationships. Several interesting characters of Byronosaurus jaffei have implications both for theropod relationships and for understanding patterns of variation within coelurosaurian theropods. These include the position of a foramen that marks the exit of the supra-alveolar canal (which we suggest is homologous with the subnarial foramen), the flattened internarial bar, the unusual interfenestral bar, and the unserrated teeth. Additionally, the well-preserved braincase allows detailed comparison with other troodontid taxa.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Anchiceratops is a chasmosaurine ceratopsid from the Upper Cretaceous Horseshoe Canyon Formation (HCF) of Alberta. It is distinguished primarily by its unique parietosquamosal frill ornamentation and possibly by the presence of a ventrally flexed olfactory bulb of the brain. Although Anchiceratops is known from at least ten partial skulls, only two of these have been formally described. These skulls are not stratigraphically segregated, but they differ markedly in their proportions (e.g., supraorbital horncore and frill dimensions), causing previous authors to account for this disparity with reference to either interspecific or sexual differences. Both of these hypotheses assume that variation in Anchiceratops is dimorphic; however, this assumption has never been tested with reference to all available material. The present study describes all material from the HCF that can be positively attributed to Anchiceratops, and tests the assumption of dimorphism by subjecting this material to a series of morphometric analyses. We find no compelling evidence for dimorphism in Anchiceratops, although sample size is still too small for convincing statistical support. We conclude that there is a single, variable species of Anchiceratops, A. ornatus. Average sedimentation rates for the HCF suggest that A. ornatus is a particularly long-lived species compared with other ceratopsids (?1.5?2.0 Ma), and the paleoecological implications of this are discussed. A cladistic analysis that includes the new data presented here indicates that Anchiceratops is more closely related to Chasmosaurus than to Triceratops, in contrast with previous studies.}},

The new taxon is the first documented pre-Pleistocene record of woodpeckers from the entire African continent and it is clearly distinct from the three extant lineages of Picinae that are endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, i.e., Campethera-Geocolaptes, Dendropicos, and Dendrocopos obsoletus. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that the new taxon forms a clade with the extant woodpecker genera Celeus and Dryocopus, which do not occur in Africa, but in the Americas and Eurasia. The new taxon represents a previously unknown fourth lineage of African woodpeckers of Eurasian origin that probably became isolated on the African continent as a result of environmental changes during the Miocene. Evidence for an arboreal true woodpecker in the fossil record strongly supports previous hypotheses regarding the presence of riverine forests at Langebaanweg during the early Pliocene.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The Early Cretaceous of China has yielded a diverse sauropod fauna, dominated by basal titanosauriforms. Known from a basicranium, teeth and the first three cervical vertebrae, Mongolosaurus haplodon is a poorly understood taxon whose evolutionary relationship to other sauropods has remained uncertain. Redescription of Mongolosaurus identifies key features that confirm its titanosaurian affinities and demonstrate its validity, based on several autapomorphies and a unique combination of characters. Diagnostic features include: a low neural spine which does not extend above the epipophyses; the dorsal edges of the posterior articular surfaces of anterior cervical vertebrae projecting more posteriorly than the ventral edges; and postaxial spinoprezygapophyseal laminae forming a dorsoventrally elongate X-shape in anterior view. Mongolosaurus is incorporated into three independent cladistic analyses; however, its precise phylogenetic position within Titanosauria remains unclear. This is partly a consequence of the limited material, but also reflects the unusual combination of basal and derived features for this clade and the need for a better understanding of titanosaur intra-relationships. Reassessment of this animal provides new information on the atlas-axis complex, which is extremely poorly known in titanosaurs, and highlights several new characters that may prove useful in future phylogenetic analyses, such as the ratio of the transverse widths of the basal tubera and occipital condyle. A number of features pertaining to both the cranial material and cervical vertebrae are similar to those seen in some diplodocoids (including an anteroventral projection on the atlantal intercentrum and distal bifurcation of anterior cervical neural spines), providing further evidence for convergence between these two major neosauropod radiations. Other remains previously attributed to Mongolosaurus from China and Russia cannot be referred to this genus. In summary, Mongolosaurus represents one of the earliest known titanosaurs from eastern Asia and adds to our understanding of this diverse clade of sauropods.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Titanosauriforms represent a diverse and globally distributed clade of neosauropod dinosaurs, but their inter-relationships remain poorly understood. Here we redescribe Lusotitan atalaiensis from the Late Jurassic Lourinh\~{a} Formation of Portugal, a taxon previously referred to Brachiosaurus. The lectotype includes cervical, dorsal, and caudal vertebrae, and elements from the forelimb, hindlimb, and pelvic girdle. Lusotitan is a valid taxon and can be diagnosed by six autapomorphies, including the presence of elongate postzygapophyses that project well beyond the posterior margin of the neural arch in anterior-to-middle caudal vertebrae. A new phylogenetic analysis, focused on elucidating the evolutionary relationships of basal titanosauriforms, is presented, comprising 63 taxa scored for 279 characters. Many of these characters are heavily revised or novel to our study, and a number of ingroup taxa have never previously been incorporated into a phylogenetic analysis. We treated quantitative characters as discrete and continuous data in two parallel analyses, and explored the effect of implied weighting. Although we recovered monophyletic brachiosaurid and somphospondylan sister clades within Titanosauriformes, their compositions were affected by alternative treatments of quantitative data and, especially, by the weighting of such data. This suggests that the treatment of quantitative data is important and the wrong decisions might lead to incorrect tree topologies. In particular, the diversity of Titanosauria was greatly increased by the use of implied weights. Our results support the generic separation of the contemporaneous taxa Brachiosaurus, Giraffatitan, and Lusotitan, with the latter recovered as either a brachiosaurid or the sister taxon to Titanosauriformes. Although Janenschia was recovered as a basal macronarian, outside Titanosauria, the sympatric Australodocus provides body fossil evidence for the pre-Cretaceous origin of titanosaurs. We recovered evidence for a sauropod with close affinities to the Chinese taxon Mamenchisaurus in the Late Jurassic Tendaguru beds of Africa, and present new information demonstrating the wider distribution of caudal pneumaticity within Titanosauria. The earliest known titanosauriform body fossils are from the late Oxfordian (Late Jurassic), although trackway evidence indicates a Middle Jurassic origin. Diversity increased throughout the Late Jurassic, and titanosauriforms did not undergo a severe extinction across the Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary, in contrast to diplodocids and non-neosauropods. Titanosauriform diversity increased in the Barremian and Aptian–Albian as a result of radiations of derived somphospondylans and lithostrotians, respectively, but there was a severe drop (up to 40\%) in species numbers at, or near, the Albian/Cenomanian boundary, representing a faunal turnover whereby basal titanosauriforms were replaced by derived titanosaurs, although this transition occurred in a spatiotemporally staggered fashion. {\copyright} 2013 The Linnean Society of London}},

  Abstract                 = {{Although diplodocoid sauropods from Africa and the Americas are well known, their European record remains largely neglected. Here we redescribe Dinheirosaurus lourinhanensis from the Late Jurassic of Portugal. The holotype comprises two posterior cervical vertebrae, the dorsal series and a caudal centrum. Redescription demonstrates its validity on the basis of three autapomorphies: (1) posteriorly restricted ventral keel on posterior cervical vertebrae; (2) three small subcircular fossae posterior to the lateral coel on posterior cervical neural spines; (3) accessory lamina linking the hyposphene with base of the posterior centrodiapophyseal lamina in middle-posterior dorsal vertebrae. Phylogenetic analysis places Dinheirosaurus as the sister taxon to Supersaurus, and this clade forms the sister taxon to other diplodocines. However, this position should be treated with caution as Dinheirosaurus displays several plesiomorphic features absent in other diplodocids (including unbifurcated presacral neural spines, and dorsolaterally projecting diapophyses on dorsal vertebrae) and only four additional steps are required to place Dinheirosaurus outside of Flagellicaudata. We identify Amazonsaurus as the basal-most rebbachisaurid and recover Zapalasaurus outside of the South American Limaysaurinae, suggesting the biogeographic history of rebbachisaurids is more complex than previously proposed. Review of the European diplodocoid record reveals evidence for the earliest known diplodocid, as well as additional diplodocid remains from the Late Jurassic of Spain. A Portuguese specimen, previously referred to Dinheirosaurus, displays strong similarities to Apatosaurus from the contemporaneous Morrison Formation of North America, indicating the presence of a second Late Jurassic Portuguese diplodocid taxon. Along with Dinheirosaurus, these Portuguese remains provide further evidence for a Late Jurassic palaeobiogeographic connection between Europe and North America. No dicraeosaurids are currently known from Europe, but rebbachisaurids are present in the Early Cretaceous, with weak evidence for the earliest known representative from the Late Jurassic of Spain; however, more complete material is required to recognize early members of this clade.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Here we report a new early Oligocene cricetid, Paracricetops virgatoincisus, gen. et sp. nov., discovered from the Caijiachong locality in Yunnan Province, China. This new cricetid shows a peculiar combination of characters, such as massive and transversely positioned cusps, crenulated cheek tooth enamel, and a deep fossette enclosed between protocone and paracone. These characters are also present in Cricetops, a cricetid rodent of which the phylogenetic relationship with other cricetids remains debatable. Our phylogenetic analysis based on a data matrix including 37 taxa and 67 morphological characters reveals that Paracricetops and Cricetops are sister groups. Paracricetops, Cricetops, Deperetomys, Meteamys, Selenomys, Melissiodon, Mirrabella, Enginia, Muhsinia, and Aralocricetodon constitute a monophyletic group. This result suggests that these genera should all be grouped in the subfamily Cricetopinae. Our phylogenetic analysis also casts new lights on the origin and early radiation of the family Cricetidae. The subfamily Pappocricetodontinae is a polyphyletic group. Pappocricetodon and Raricricetodon, two basal cricetid genera, are also polyphyletic. A thorough systematic revision of these basal cricetids is needed. Chronological distribution of Eucricetodontinae, Paracricetodontinae, Pseudocricetodontinae, and Cricetopinae indicates that the establishment of these cricetid clades should be in the late Eocene at least. We therefore deduced that the first diversification and dispersal of the family Cricetidae across Eurasia must have occurred well before the Eocene-Oligocene transition.

  Abstract                 = {{Miles ('77) has produced the only comprehensive cladistic analysis of the Dipnoi. His phylogeny involves both definitely and uncertainly placed genera. An analysis of the data for the definitely placed genera, using a Wagner routine, showed that his phylogeny is similar to two of eight equally parsimonious cladograms. Analysis of the data for all the genera of Miles's phylogeny produced sixteen equally parsimonious cladograms. They have a wide range of topologies, none of which corresponds to Miles's phylogeny. It is shown that Miles employed some character weighting to obtain his phylogeny. A cladogram is presented based on Campbell and Barwick's ('83, '84) study of early dipnoan dentitions. The phylogenetic conclusions drawn from Campbell and Barwick's work are dependent on stratigraphic and functional data. The resulting cladogram differs from all the trees produced by the re-analysis of Miles's complete phylogeny; it is less parsimonious and requires that the type of dentition consisting of a shagreen of small denticles that are shed during growth is an advanced dipnoan feature rather than a primitive one. Campbell and Barwick's ('83) phylogeny is favored since, for theoretical and practical reasons, parsimony is not a good criterion for choosing between the possible phylogenies for dipnoans. Campbell and Barwick's ('83) phylogenetic conclusions are based on a richer empirical base and are more consistent with observed functional trends. A new phylogeny of the Dipnoi is presented, with the basic structure being defined by the conclusions drawn from Campbell and Barwick's ('83) work, namely, that patterns of dentition characterized by expanding growth and fusion of denticles or of the development of organized tooth plates each arose only once in evolution. The addition of Miles's ('77) characters, using the principle of parsimony, gives the fine structure of the phylogeny.}},

Diagnostic autapomorphies and combination of characters of Adeopapposaurus include a series of large foramina in a sub-vertical row on the lateral surface of the premaxilla; strongly rugose depression bordered by a protuberance with a series of foramina in a sub-vertical row, on the lateral surface of the anterior end of the dentary; eleven anteroposteriorly elongated cervical vertebrae and thirteen dorsal vertebrae with neural arches taller than the respective centra. Phylogenetically Adeopapposaurus is resolved as the sister group to Massospondylus; differing from the latter based on differences in mandible and premaxilla and addition of one dorsal vertebra to the neck. The specimens described here reveal numerous herbivorous adaptations, including the presence of a highly vascularized bony plate in the premaxilla and dentary, which indicates that it had a horny beak.}},

Small species with an adult body mass less than five tonnes are very rare4, 5, and small sauropod bones generally represent juveniles. Here we describe a new diminutive species of basal macronarian sauropod, Europasaurus holgeri gen. et sp. nov., and on the basis of bone histology we show it to have been a dwarf species. The fossils, including excellent skull material, come from Kimmeridgian marine beds of northern Germany6, 7, and record more than 11 individuals of sauropods 1.7 to 6.2 m in total body length. Morphological overlap between partial skeletons and isolated bones links all material to the same new taxon. Cortical histology of femora and tibiae indicates that size differences within the specimens are due to different ontogenetic stages, from juveniles to fully grown individuals. The little dinosaurs must have lived on one of the large islands around the Lower Saxony basin8. Comparison with the long-bone histology of large-bodied sauropods suggests that the island dwarf species evolved through a decrease in growth rate from its larger ancestor.}},

They complement the original material of 'Crocodilus affuvelensis' described by Matheron (1869) and Repelin (1930). Based on overlapping specimens, available elements of the rostrum, the palate, the skull table, the mandible and the pterygoid can be shown to belong to a single taxon, for which a reconstruction is proposed. Designation of a neotype has been proposed to the ICZN committee. A new genus, Massaliasuchus, is proposed here to designate the crocodylian originally described as Crocodilus affuvelensis. This crocodylian presents affinities with basal alligatoroids and complements the picture of crocodylian diversity during the Late Cretaceous in the European archipelago. Massaliasuchus affuvelensis is compared with other European taxa and with basal alligatoroids from North America. The putative basal position of Massaliasuchus as well as its early geological age suggest that the geographical origin of the Alligatoroidea is still uncertain. {\copyright} 2008 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2008, 152, 567–580.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Upper Triassic rocks in northwestern Argentina preserve the most complete record of dinosaurs before their rise to dominance in the Early Jurassic. Here, we describe a previously unidentified basal theropod, reassess its contemporary Eoraptor as a basal sauropodomorph, divide the faunal record of the Ischigualasto Formation with biozones, and bracket the formation with 40Ar/39Ar ages. Some 230 million years ago in the Late Triassic (mid Carnian), the earliest dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial carnivores and small herbivores in southwestern Pangaea. The extinction of nondinosaurian herbivores is sequential and is not linked to an increase in dinosaurian diversity, which weakens the predominant scenario for dinosaurian ascendancy as opportunistic replacement.}},

A comparative description with other taxa of rauisuchians is presented that forms the basis of a phylogenetic analysis. To perform the phylogenetic analysis, we describe and discuss each character codification for a modified version of the recent matrices of Gower (2002), Gower \& Nesbitt (2006) and Brusatte et al. (2010). The analysis resulted in two most parsimonious trees that differ from the topologies recovered by Gower (2002) in a few aspects within Rauisuchia, and Prestosuchus chiniquensis was unequivocally depicted as deeply nested within Pseudosuchia, as the sister taxon of Batrachotomus kuperferzellensis in both topologies, supported by a single synapomorphy: the reduced to small fissure of the post-temporal fenestra between parietal, supraoccipital and exoccipital-opisthotic.}},

The large Cretaceous-Eocene neochoristoderes Champsosaurus and Simoedosaurus are the most familiar taxa, but many smaller representatives have since been recognized. Neochoristoderes disappeared from the fossil record in the Eocene, but choristoderes survived into the European Neogene in the form of the small, superficially lizard-like Lazarussuchus. This taxon was originally described from the late Oligocene of France but has subsequently been recorded from the early Miocene of the Czech Republic and the late Oligocene of Germany. Despite its age, most phylogenetic analyses place Lazarussuchus at or close to the base of the choristoderan tree, implying a very long unrecorded history. A new specimen of Lazarussuchus from the late Paleocene locality of Menat, France, partly fills that hiatus. The genus was thus present in the waterways of western Europe for at least 30 Ma, and was probably considerably more widespread than current records suggest. A new phylogenetic analysis confirms its placement outside Neochoristodera, but the relationships of non-neochoristoderan taxa remain incompletely resolved.}},

Arthropterygius can be referred to the Ophthalmosauria based on the presence of a preaxial element anterior to the radius and ulna. This referral is supported by a phylogenetic analysis, in which a sister-group relationship between Arthropterygius and the South American genus Caypullisaurus is recovered. This specimen represents the most complete ichthyosaur from the Canadian Arctic, and has important implications for marine reptile diversity at high latitudes during the Jurassic.}},

The ongoing debate over their deep divergences is despite recent increases in available molecular sequence data and the publication of several larger morphological data sets. In the present study, the phylogenetic relationships among 43 neornithine higher taxa are addressed using a data set of 148 osteological and soft tissue characters, which is one of the largest to date. The Mesozoic non-neornithine birds Apsaravis, Hesperornis, and Ichthyornis are used as outgroup taxa for this analysis. Thus, for the first time, a broad array of morphological characters (including both cranial and postcranial characters) are analyzed for an ingroup densely sampling Neornithes, with crown clade outgroups used to polarize these characters. The strict consensus cladogram of two most parsimonious trees resultant from 1000 replicate heuristic searches (random stepwise addition, tree-bisection-reconnection) recovered several previously identified clades; the at-one-time contentious clades Galloanseres (waterfowl, fowl, and allies) and Palaeognathae were supported. Most notably, our analysis recovered monophyly of Neoaves, i.e., all neognathous birds to the exclusion of the Galloanseres, although this clade was weakly supported. The recently proposed sister taxon relationship between Steatornithidae (oilbird) and Trogonidae (trogons) was recovered. The traditional taxon "Falconiformes" (Cathartidae, Sagittariidae, Accipitridae, and Falconidae) was not found to be monophyletic, as Strigiformes (owls) are placed as the sister taxon of (Falconidae + Accipitridae). Monophyly of the traditional "Gruiformes" (cranes and allies) and "Ciconiiformes" (storks and allies) was also not recovered. The primary analysis resulted in support for a sister group relationship between Gaviidae (loons) and Podicipedidae (grebes)2014foot-propelled diving birds that share many features of the pelvis and hind limb. Exclusion of Gaviidae and reanalysis of the data set, however, recovered the sister group relationship between Phoenicopteridae (flamingos) and grebes recently proposed from molecular sequence data.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The precise phylogenetic relationships of many non-hadrosaurid members of Iguanodontia, i.e., basal iguanodonts, have been unclear. Therefore, to investigate the global phylogeny of basal iguanodonts a comprehensive data matrix was assembled, including nearly every valid taxon of basal iguanodont. The matrix was analyzed in the program TNT, and the maximum agreement subtree of the resulting most parsimonious trees was then calculated in PAUP. Ordering certain multistate characters and omitting taxa through safe taxonomic reduction did not markedly improve resolution. The results provide some new information on the phylogeny of basal iguanodonts, pertaining especially to obscure or recently described taxa, and support some recent taxonomic revisions, such as the splitting of traditional ” Camptosaurus” and ” Iguanodon”. The maximum agreement subtree also shows a close relationship between the Asian Probactrosaurus gobiensis and the North American Eolambia, supporting the previous hypothesis of faunal interchange between Asia and North America in the early Late Cretaceous. Nevertheless, the phylogenetic relationships of many basal iguanodonts remain ambiguous due to the high number of taxa removed from the maximum agreement subtree and poor resolution of consensus trees.}},

Rubeosaurus has been historically the most enigmatic of these taxa; only two specimens, the holotype caudal parietal bar and a referred incomplete skull, have been assigned to Rubeosaurus. A revised interpretation of the parietal processes of USNM 14765, the partial skeleton of a subadult centrosaurine formerly referred to Brachyceratops, indicates that it shares a P5 spike with the holotype of Rubeosaurus ovatus and should therefore be referred to that taxon. Brachyceratops is considered a nomen dubium. USNM 14765 provides additional anatomical information for Rubeosaurus ovatus. These new data are incorporated into a recent phylogenetic analysis of centrosaurine relationships; Rubeosaurus appears as the sister taxon of a clade composed of Einiosaurus, Achelousaurus, and Pachyrhinosaurus.}},

Iguanacolossus fortis gen. et sp. nov. and Hippodraco scutodens gen. et sp. nov. are each diagnosed by a single autapomorphy and a unique combination of characters. Iguanacolossus and Hippodraco add greatly to our knowledge of North American basal iguanodonts and prompt a new comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of basal iguanodont relationships.

A preliminary phylogenetic analysis reveals that Jeyawati is a basal hadrosauroid more derived than Probactrosaurus, Eolambia, and Protohadros, but more basal than Shuangmiaosaurus, Bactrosaurus, and Telmatosaurus. Assessment of ontogenetic criteria indicates that MSM P4166 represents a subadult or adult individual.

  Abstract                 = {{Prosaurolophus maximus Brown is a saurolophine hadrosaurid known from numerous complete, articulated skulls from the Dinosaur Park Formation (Campanian, Alberta, Canada) that range in size by approximately half a metre in total skull length. Therefore, it is an important taxon for understanding patterns of growth and variation in saurolophines. This study describes the cranial anatomy of P. maximus from the type locality of Dinosaur Provincial Park (Dinosaur Park Formation: Campanian) on the basis of ten articulated skulls, quantitatively examines its range of osteological variation, and provides the first hypothesized ontogenetic series for this taxon. A second species, Prosaurolophus blackfeetensis Horner, was named on the basis of geologically younger material from Montana (Two Medicine Formation: Campanian) that is diagnosed by putative morphological differences in the nasal crest. However, considerable nasal crest variation in the sample from the Dinosaur Park Formation does not permit quantitative differentiation of P. blackfeetensis from P. maximus. Furthermore, a species-level phylogenetic analysis of saurolophines that includes both P. maximus and P. blackfeetensis as originally defined recovers them as sister taxa that do not differ morphologically in the character matrix. Based on both the morphometric and phylogenetic data, this study supports the hypothesis that P. blackfeetensis is a junior synonym of P. maximus, thereby substantially increasing its temporal range to 1.6 million years, and a concomitant period of morphological stasis in this taxon. {\copyright} 2013 The Linnean Society of London}},

  Abstract                 = {{Albanerpetontids were small, terrestrial amphibians with robust limbs and tails. They are known from deposits from the Middle Jurassic (Bajocian) to the Miocene of Europe, North America and Central Asia. They can be diagnosed by a series of unique derived character states, which include an interdigitating mandibular symphysis, an atlas-axis joint analogous to that of mammals and regular polygonal sculpturing on dermal roofing bones of the skull. They remained remarkably conservative throughout their long history, but the shape of their frontals appears to diagnose genera as well as species. Previous descriptions of albanerpetontids were based on disarticulated remains. Described here in detail are two complete specimens from the Cretaceous (Berriasian) of Spain; one, particularly well-preserved specimen has traces of skin and possibly male courtship glands. A description of the albanerpetontid specimen from the Cretaceous (Albian) of Italy is also given. Previous authors have placed albanerpetontids as either true caudates or as a sister-group of caudates. This new material helps to clarify the systematic position of the group; character analyses show them to be clearly not true caudates but possibly a sister-group of salamanders plus frogs (±gymnophionans). Their relationships with Palaeozoic amphibians remains equivocal with an ancestor most likely to be found in either the microsaurs, or amphibamid or branchiosaurid temnospondyls. {\copyright} 2002 The Linnean Society of London.

  Abstract                 = {{A method for quantifying levels of observed homoplasy in cladistic analyses is proposed. The homoplasy slope is a function that describes the relationship between number of taxa in a cladistic analysis and the observed number of extra steps per character. The homoplasy slope ratio (HSR) relates the homoplasy slope of a cladistic analysis (real data) to that of an analysis based on random binary data sets of the same size. Tests show that HSR is not correlated with numbers of characters and taxa, and this quality makes the index particularly useful for comparing the levels of observed homoplasy among cladistic analyses based on data sets of different sizes. All of the other homoplasy indices currently available-including the consistency index (CI), retention index (RI), and homoplasy excess ratio (HER)-are correlated with number of characters and/or number of taxa.}},

  Abstract                 = {{A phylogenetic analysis of Recent and fossil species of the genus <i>Amalda</i> (Gastropoda) was undertaken. The resulting cladogram is compared with the phylogeny implied by stratigraphic evidence. The two phylogenies are in broad agreement, and both suggest that the subgenus <i>Alocospira</i> should be elevated to generic rank. The status of the subgenus <i>Gracilispira</i> is uncertain on both cladistic and stratigraphic grounds. Of the two remaining subgenera, only <i>Baryspira</i> is unequivocally monophyletic. <i>Gemaspira</i> and <i>Baryspira</i> are sister taxa in the cladistic analysis. However, stratigraphic evidence strongly suggests that <i>Gemaspira</i> is a paraphyletic group. The implied sister-group relationship is interpreted as resulting from coding procedures which assumed no transformation series between states of a multistate character. Clearly, stratigraphic evidence implies that the synapomorphies linking <i>Baryspira</i> spp. are transformations from (rather than being independent of) the synapomorphies linking <i>Gemaspira</i> spp. This underlines the importance of deducing the correct transformations linking multistate characters in attempting to reconstruct phylogenies. In this case the transformation series implied are counter-intuitive. It is concluded that cladistic analysis of morphological characters has the potential to reconstruct phylogenies provided the correct transformation series are known. These, it is argued, can be obtained through a study of the dynamics of form development.}},

The new material from Qujing, Yunnan, southwestern China, represents the oldest known sarcopterygian fish and extends the record of sarcopterygians to the Late Silurian, or about 410 Ma. The new form is close to Youngolepis and Powichthys at the base of the Crossopterygii. Similarities among the lower jaws of onychodonts, porolepiforms, Youngolepis, Powichthys and the new form support a position of onychodonts within the Crossopterygii. Four characters in the character matrix of Cloutier \& Ahlberg (1996, in Stiassny et al: Interrelationships of Fishes, Academic Press) are reviewed, and sarcopterygian interrelationships are studied on the basis of their data with minor modifications. The new scheme of sarcopterygian interrelationships differs markedly from Cloutier \& Ahlberg's scheme. Neither actinistians nor onychodonts are situated at the base of Sarcopterygii, but within the Crossopterygii. Youngolepis and Powichthys are at the base of the Crossopterygii, instead of being the sister group of dipnoans plus Diabolepis.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The Hamitidae are a family of mid–Cretaceous heteromorph ammonites including lineages leading to four other families. Problems are outlined in trying to describe the phylogeny of completely extinct groups such as these heteromorph ammonites using the existing cladistic terminology, which is largely concerned with extant taxa and their ancestors. To solve these problems, two new terms are proposed: {\dag}crown groups and {\dag}stem groups, which are equivalent to crown and stem groups in terms of the evolutionary history of a clade, but are not defined on the basis of extant taxa. Instead they are defined by the topology of the phylogenetic tree, the {\dag}crown group being a clade defined by synapomorphies but which gave rise to no descendants. A {\dag}stem group is a branch of a phylogenetic tree which comprises the immediate sister groups of a given {\dag}crown group but is not itself a clade. Examples of these terms are described here with reference to the phylogeny of the Hamitidae and their descendants. The Hamitidae are paraphyletic and form {\dag}stem groups to a number of {\dag}crown groups, namely the Anisoceratidae, Baculitidae, Scaphitidae, and Turrilitidae. The definitions of the genera and subgenera are refined with respect to the type species and the clades within which they occur, and four new genera are described: Eohamites, Helicohamites, Sziveshamites, and Planohamites.}},

All ichthyosaurs from post-Triassic strata form an unnamed clade, which in turn forms the group Euichthyosauria (new taxon) with four Late Triassic genera. The traditional Shastasauridae is polyphyletic, with Cymbospondylus forming the sistergroup of a clade containing mixosaurs, shastasaurs, and euichthyosaurs. In addition, Californosaurus and Toretocnemus are not shastasaurs but euichthyosaurs. Two new generic names, Macgowania and Isfjordosaurus, are proposed.}},

This fish is a stem osteoglossomorph that cannot be included in either the Hiodontiformes or Osteoglossiformes without making either order polyphyletic. The fossils from the Changma locality are exceptionally well preserved, and allow many details of the anatomy of the new fish to be described, including the presence of a postpelvic bone, which was previously only known to be present in the living Hiodon. The relationships of the osteoglossomorph fishes are still not well resolved, and the addition of the new species to previous phylogenetic analyses causes even less resolution to be found. However, the new species appears to be more derived than Lycoptera and Paralycoptera, two other well-known stem osteoglossomorphs.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Rhoetosaurus brownei is the only known named pre-Cretaceous sauropod from Australia. It is therefore a potentially important taxon for understanding global paleobiogeographic and phylogenetic patterns among early sauropods. Despite its obvious significance, Rhoetosaurus has been too poorly understood to be included in most recent analyses of early sauropod evolution. With this in mind, we evaluated the osteology and phylogeny of undescribed materials of Rhoetosaurus, in order to attempt to close the gap in this understanding. The lower hind limb of Rhoetosaurus highlights a plethora of differences from other sauropods, supporting the distinctiveness of Rhoetosaurus even in the absence of other materials. Some unique traits include prominent crests and sulci on the tibia medially, a narrow metatarsal articular bridge, and pedal claws with an accessory groove or fossa. The pes plesiomorphically retains four claws where most sauropods have three, and bears superficial similarity to that of Shunosaurus. Preliminary cladistic analysis confirms that Rhoetosaurus is a non-neosauropod gravisaurian, although weak support for the most parsimonious topology suggests further findings are required to improve upon incompleteness in the character data. Examination of alternative phylogenetic hypotheses rules out a close relationship between Rhoetosaurus and East Asian Jurassic sauropods, and indicates a closer examination of the potential relationships between Rhoetosaurus and other contemporaneous Middle Jurassic Gondwanan sauropods is necessary.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Pterosaurs have been known from the Cretaceous sediments of the Isle of Wight (southern England, United Kingdom) since 1870. We describe the three-dimensional pelvic girdle and associated vertebrae of a small near-adult pterodactyloid from the Atherfield Clay Formation (lower Aptian, Lower Cretaceous). Despite acknowledged variation in the pterosaur pelvis, previous studies have not adequately sampled or incorporated pelvic characters into phylogenetic analyses. The new specimen represents the new taxon Vectidraco daisymorrisae gen. et sp. nov., diagnosed by the presence of a concavity posterodorsal to the acetabulum and the form of its postacetabular process on the ilium. Several characters suggest that Vectidraco belongs to Azhdarchoidea. We constructed a pelvis-only phylogenetic analysis to test whether the pterosaur pelvis carries a useful phylogenetic signal. Resolution in recovered trees was poor, but they approximately matched trees recovered from analyses of total evidence. We also added Vectidraco and our pelvic characters to an existing total-evidence matrix for pterosaurs. Both analyses recovered Vectidraco within Azhdarchoidea. The Lower Cretaceous strata of western Europe have yielded members of several pterosaur lineages, but Aptian pterosaurs from western Europe are rare. With a pelvis length of 40 mm, the new animal would have had a total length of c. 350 mm, and a wingspan of c. 750 mm. Barremian and Aptian pterodactyloids from western Europe show that small-bodied azhdarchoids lived alongside ornithocheirids and istiodactylids. This assemblage is similar in terms of which lineages are represented to the coeval beds of Liaoning, China; however, the number of species and specimens present at Liaoning is much higher. While the general phylogenetic composition of western European and Chinese communities appear to have been approximately similar, the differences may be due to different palaeoenvironmental and depositional settings. The western Europe pterodactyloid record may therefore be artificially low in diversity due to preservational factors.}},

The skull is described and compared to other suchian and basal archosaurs. The maxilla and premaxilla are edentulous, and a rhamphotheca was possibly present in life. Effigia conclusively indicates that the skull of Shuvosaurus and the postcrania of ?Chatterjeea? belong to the same taxon. Furthermore, the close relationship between Shuvosaurus and Effigia indicates that both taxa are nested within the suchian clade and not within Ornithomimisauria. However, the similarity in features in the skull and postcrania of Effigia and ornithomimids suggests extreme convergence occurred between the two clades. A clade containing Arizonasaurus, Bromsgroveia, Poposaurus, Sillosuchus, Shuvosaurus, and Effigia is suggested based solely on shared derived character states. Additionally, a clade (Clade Y) containing Sillosuchus, Shuvosaurus, and Effigia is well supported by further derived character states. The distribution and temporal pattern of members of Group Y suggest that members of Group Y are present in the early Middle Triassic through the Latest Triassic of North America, and one member of the clade, Sillosuchus, was present in South America.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract Archosaurs have a nearly 250 million year record that originated shortly after the Permian-Triassic extinction event and is continued today by two extant clades, the crocodylians and the avians. The two extant lineages exemplify two bauplan extremes among a diverse and complex evolutionary history, but little is known about the common ancestor of these lineages. Renewed interest in early archosaurs has led to nearly a doubling of the known taxa in the last 20 years. This study presents a thorough phylogenetic analysis of 80 species-level taxa ranging from the latest Permian to the early part of the Jurassic using a dataset of 412 characters. Each terminal taxon is explicitly described and all specimens used in the analysis are clearly stated. Additionally, each character is discussed in detail and nearly all of the character states are illustrated in either a drawing or highlighted on a specimen photograph. A combination of novel characters and comprehensive character sampling has bridged previously published analyses that focus on particular archosauriform subclades. A well-resolved, robustly supported consensus tree (MPTs ?=? 360) found a monophyletic Archosauria consisting of two major branches, the crocodylian-line and avian-line lineages. The monophyly of clades such as Ornithosuchidae, Phytosauria, Aetosauria, Crocodylomorpha, and Dinosauria is supported in this analysis. However, phytosaurs are recovered as the closest sister taxon to Archosauria, rather than basal crocodylian-line archosaurs, for the first time. Among taxa classically termed as ?rauisuchians,? a monophyletic poposauroid clade was found as the sister taxon to a group of paraphyletic ?rauisuchians? and monophyletic crocodylomorphs. Hence, crocodylomorphs are well nested within a clade of ?rauisuchians,? and are not more closely related to aetosaurs than to taxa such as Postosuchus. Basal crocodylomorphs such as Hesperosuchus and similar forms (?Sphenosuchia?) were found as a paraphyletic grade leading to the clade Crocodyliformes. Among avian-line archosaurs, Dinosauria is well supported. A monophyletic clade containing Silesaurus and similar forms is well supported as the sister taxon to Dinosauria. Pterosaurs are robustly supported at the base of the avian line. A time-calibrated phylogeny of Archosauriformes indicates that the origin and initial diversification of Archosauria occurred during the Early Triassic following the Permian-Triassic extinction. Furthermore, all major basal archosaur lineages except Crocodylomorpha were established by the end of the Anisian. Early archosaur evolution is characterized by high rates of homoplasy, long ghost lineages, and high rates of character evolution. These data imply that much of the early history of Archosauria has not been recovered from the fossil record. Not only were archosaurs diverse by the Middle Triassic, but they had nearly a cosmopolitan biogeographic distribution by the end of the Anisian.}},

A recently discovered skeleton referable to Arizonasaurus babbitti shows that most of these archosaurian remains belong to one taxon. Characteristics of the skeleton of Arizonasaurus show that it belongs to a poorly known group of Middle Triassic (240-230 Myr ago) archosaurs called the ctenosauriscids, and that ctenosauriscids are or are closely related to poposaurs. Furthermore, many characteristics of Arizonasaurus provide evidence that poposaurids and ctenosauriscids are derived rauisuchians. The presence of a poposaurid in the early Middle Triassic suggests that the divergence of birds and crocodiles occurred earlier than previously thought. Middle Triassic ctenosauriscids also allow the correlation of Triassic faunas in Europe, Asia, North America and Africa. The Moenkopi Formation fauna represents a transitional fauna between Early and Late Triassic faunas.}},

It demonstrates that the initial dinosaur radiation occurred over a longer timescale than previously thought (possibly 15 Myr earlier), and that dinosaurs and their immediate relatives are better understood as part of a larger Middle Triassic archosauriform radiation.

  Abstract                 = {{Parringtonia gracilis Huene, 1939 is represented by both cranial and postcranial material collected from the lower Middle Triassic (Anisian) Lifua Member of the Manda beds in southwestern Tanzania. This aberrant taxon was previously proposed to have affinities with pseudosuchian archosaurs, and specifically with the enigmatic Erpetosuchus granti from the Upper Triassic of Scotland. Here, we confirm the close affinities of Parringtonia gracilis and Erpetosuchus granti based on the following unambiguous synapomorphies: mediolaterally expanded posterior portion of the maxilla, alveoli present only in the anterior half of the maxilla, and absence of tooth serrations. Furthermore, the two taxa share osteoderms with deep sculpturing, a deep fossa on the dorsal margin of the neural spines and a heavily waisted shaft of the scapula. We added both Parringtonia gracilis and Erpetosuchus granti into a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of early archosaurs and found that these taxa are clearly referable to Archosauria but that relationships are poorly resolved at the base of this clade. However, our analysis demonstrates that Erpetosuchus granti is not closely related to Crocodylomorpha, as has been hypothesized previously. The Erpetosuchidae are a clade of small-bodied archosaurs that have a poor fossil record but have members from both northern and southern Pangaea, ranging temporally from the Middle to Late Triassic. Thus, Erpetosuchidae is part of the early archosaurian radiation.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT A partial postcranial skeleton of a small alvarezsaurid from the Late Cretaceous of the Mongolian eastern Gobi Desert locality of Khugenetslavkant represents the first reported articulated theropod material from that locality. The specimen is recognized as the holotype of a new taxon herein named Albinykus baatar, gen. et sp. nov. Phylogenetic analysis places Albinykus within Alvarezsauridae as the sister taxon of Shuvuuia, another Late Cretaceous Mongolian taxon from the slightly younger Djadokhta Formation. The complete coossification of the proximal tarsals with the tibia, and of the distal tarsals and proximal metatarsals, present in Albinykus are previously unknown in Alvarezsauridae. Extensive fusion is consistent with histological data from the tibia indicating that the individual was a subadult. These results are striking given that Albinykus is among the smallest known non-avian dinosaurs with a body mass no greater than 1 kg and ranks among the smallest known alvarezsaurids. Alvarezsauridae shows a decreasing size trend throughout its evolutionary history, a rarity among dinosaurian clades. Within maniraptoran dinosaurs, such a trend has thus far only been recognized within Avialae and at the origin of Paraves with respect to other coelurosaurs. The holotype was recovered articulated in a ?seated? position, with hind limbs aligned and the feet tucked under the body. This body posture, which is present in Aves, has been previously noted in other maniraptoran clades (i.e., Oviraptoridae Troodontidae) and is now recognized in Alvarezsauridae.}},

Hindlimb material (femora, tibiae, a fibula, astragalocalcanea, and phalanges) of Dromomeron romeri, a non-dinosauriform dinosauromorph from the Petrified Forest Member of the Chinle Formation from north-central New Mexico, is described. A new species of Dromomeron from the lower portion of the Chinle Formation (eastern Arizona) and Dockum Group (northern Texas) is also described, based on several disarticulated femora and tibiae. D. romeri, Lagerpeton, and the new taxon form the sister group to all other dinosauromorphs and demonstrate that this clade, Lagerpetidae, persisted well into the Norian. Lagerpetidae is supported by several synapomorphies: femoral head hook-shaped in medial and lateral views; ventral emargination on the anterolateral side of the femoral head; an enlarged posteromedial tuber of the proximal end of the femur; femoral crista tibiofibularis larger than the medial condyle; anteromedial corner of the distal end of the femur forms 90° or acute (>90°) angle; and a posterior ascending process of the astragalus. An ontogenetic series of the femur of Dromomeron indicates that some character states previously used in phylogenetic analyses of early dinosaurs may be ontogenetically variable.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The early evolutionary history of Ornithodira (avian-line archosaurs) has hitherto been documented by incomplete (Lagerpeton 1) or unusually specialized forms (pterosaurs and Silesaurus 2). Recently, a variety of Silesaurus-like taxa have been reported from the Triassic period of both Gondwana and Laurasia, but their relationships to each other and to dinosaurs remain a subject of debate3, 4, 5. Here we report on a new avian-line archosaur from the early Middle Triassic (Anisian) of Tanzania. Phylogenetic analysis places Asilisaurus kongwe gen. et sp. nov. as an avian-line archosaur and a member of the Silesauridae, which is here considered the sister taxon to Dinosauria. Silesaurids were diverse and had a wide distribution by the Late Triassic, with a novel ornithodiran bauplan including leaf-shaped teeth, a beak-like lower jaw, long, gracile limbs, and a quadrupedal stance. Our analysis suggests that the dentition and diet of silesaurids, ornithischians and sauropodomorphs evolved independently from a plesiomorphic carnivorous form. As the oldest avian-line archosaur, Asilisaurus demonstrates the antiquity of both Ornithodira and the dinosaurian lineage. The initial diversification of Archosauria, previously documented by crocodilian-line archosaurs in the Anisian6, can now be shown to include a contemporaneous avian-line radiation. The unparalleled taxonomic diversity of the Manda archosaur assemblage indicates that archosaur diversification was well underway by the Middle Triassic or earlier.}},

We present here a detailed comparative description based on a nearly complete, articulated skeleton from the Coelophysis Quarry in north-central New Mexico and other fragmentary specimens. The unique combination of morphological features of Vancleavea is unparalleled within Reptilia; it has four unique morphologies of imbricated osteoderms covering the entire body, a short, highly ossified skull, relatively small limbs and morphological features consistent with a semi-aquatic lifestyle. Vancleavea is placed in a rigorous phylogenetic analysis examining the relationships of non-archosaurian archosauriforms, and is found to be more closely related to Archosauria than both Erythrosuchus and Proterosuchus, but outside of the crown group. The analysis confirms previously hypothesized relationships, which found Euparkeria to be the closest sister taxon of Archosauria. It is not clear whether specimens referred to Vancleavea campi represent a single species-level taxon or a clade of closely related taxa that lived through much of the Late Triassic of North America, given the poor fossil record of the taxon. {\\\\\\\\copyright} 2009 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2009, 157, 8142013864.},

We review furcula development, function, and morphology, as well as the anatomical terminology applied to it. Furcular morphology is highly variable in crown-group avians but is rather conserved among nonavian theropods. Here we review, or describe for the first time, the furculae in many nonavian theropods. Furculae occur in nearly all major clades of theropods, as shown by new theropod specimens from the Early Cretaceous of China and a close inspection of previously collected specimens. Informative phylogenetic characters pertaining to the furcula occur throughout Theropoda, though care should betake to consider taphonomic effects when describing furcular morphology.

  Abstract                 = {{The Parsimony Ratchet1 is presented as a new method for analysis of large data sets. The method can be easily implemented with existing phylogenetic software by generating batch command files. Such an approach has been implemented in the programs DADA (Nixon, 1998) and Winclada (Nixon, 1999). The Parsimony Ratchet has also been implemented in the most recent versions of NONA (Goloboff, 1998). These implementations of the ratchet use the following steps: (1) Generate a starting tree (e.g., a ” Wagner” tree followed by some level of branch swapping or not). (2) Randomly select a subset of characters, each of which is given additional weight (e.g., add 1 to the weight of each selected character). (3) Perform branch swapping (e.g., ” branch-breaking” or TBR) on the current tree using the reweighted matrix, keeping only one (or few) tree. (4) Set all weights for the characters to the ” original” weights (typically, equal weights). (5) Perform branch swapping (e.g., branch-breaking or TBR) on the current tree (from step 3) holding one (or few) tree. (6) Return to step 2. Steps 2–6 are considered to be one iteration, and typically, 50–200 or more iterations are performed. The number of characters to be sampled for reweighting in step 2 is determined by the user; I have found that between 5 and 25\% of the characters provide good results in most cases. The performance of the ratchet for large data sets is outstanding, and the results of analyses of the 500 taxon seed plant rbcL data set (Chase et al., 1993) are presented here. A separate analysis of a three-gene data set for 567 taxa will be presented elsewhere (Soltis et al., in preparation) demonstrating the same extraordinary power. With the 500-taxon data set, shortest trees are typically found within 22 h (four runs of 200 iterations) on a 200-MHz Pentium Pro. These analyses indicate efficiency increases of 20×–80× over ” traditional methods” such as varying taxon order randomly and holding few trees, followed by more complete analyses of the best trees found, and thousands of times faster than nonstrategic searches with PAUP. Because the ratchet samples many tree islands with fewer trees from each island, it provides much more accurate estimates of the ” true” consensus than collecting many trees from few islands. With the ratchet, Goloboff's NONA, and existing computer hardware, data sets that were previously intractable or required months or years of analysis with PAUP* can now be adequately analyzed in a few hours or days.}},

Homology is not synonymous with synapomorphy: it includes symplesiomorphy, and Hennig clearly included both plesiomorphy and synapomorphy as types of homology. Homoplasy is error, in coding, and is analogous to residual error in simple regression. If parallelism and convergence are to be distinguished, homoplasy would be evidence of the former and analogy evidence of the latter. We discuss whether there is a difference between molecular homology and morphological homology, character state homology, nested homology (additive characters), and serial homology. We conclude by proposing a global definition of homology. {\copyright}The Will Henning Society 2011.}},

Tsaagan mangas differs from other dromaeosaurids in the possession of a straight, untwisted, and pendulous paroccipital process, a large and anteriorly located maxillary fenestra, and a jugal?squamosal contact that excludes the postorbital from the margin of the infratemporal fenestra. The phylogenetic affinities of Tsaagan mangas are determined through a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Coelurosauria, confirming its position within Dromaeosauridae. This new specimen, coupled with CT imaging, provides new information on the skull and braincase anatomy of dromaeosaurids.}},

Apsaravis and the controversial alvarezsaurids8 are the only avialan9 taxa known from the continental deposits at Ukhaa Tolgod, which have produced hundreds of fossil mammals, lizards and other small dinosaurs7. The new taxon, Apsaravis ukhaana, is the best-preserved specimen of a Mesozoic ornithurine bird discovered in over a century. It provides data important for assessing morphological evolution across Avialae, with implications for, first, the monophyly of Enantiornithes and Sauriurae; second, the proposition that the Mesozoic sister taxa of extant birds, as part of an 'ecological bottleneck', inhabited exclusively near-shore and marine environments2; and third, the evolution of flight after its origin.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The genus Probactrosaurus was first established for material discovered by a joint Russian/Chinese expedition to the Chinese autonomous region of Neimongol (Inner Mongolia). Fossils were collected at a site named Maorty (= Maortu). Material attributable to ornithopod dinosaurs was considered sufficiently distinct to permit the definition of two species of the new genus: Probactrosaurus gobiensis and P. alashanicus. The former species was based on a considerable quantity of skeletal material, much of which is still to be found in the collections of the Palaeontological Institute (PIN), Moscow. The latter was based on far less well-preserved specimens, including a holotype (a posterior skull roof) that can no longer be found in the collections of the PIN and which, along with other materials, was reportedly returned to the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology, Beijing. Some remnants of the original material attributed to P. alashanicus have been located in the PIN collections. Both taxa, established by A. K. Rozhdestvensky, are re-described using all of the available material collected during the early Sino-Soviet expeditions. Probactrosaurus alashanicus is considered to be a junior subjective synonym of P. gobiensis. Further comparisons are made with the recently described species Probactrosaurus mazongshanensis Lu, 1997. The latter does not appear to be referable to the genus Probactrosaurus. Probactrosaurus is a gracile ornithopod (ranging between 4 and 6 m in length). The skull is unadorned by any form of cranial crest; however, the premaxillary beak is deflected ventrally and the dentition is similar to that seen in more derived hadrosaurid ornithopods. The postcranial skeleton is notable for its gracility, in particular the elongate forearm and manus, and the retention of a small, conical pollex spine. Systematic analysis suggests that P. gobiensis is a derived non-hadrosaurid iguanodontian ornithopod and the basal sister-taxon to the clade Hadrosauridae. The phylogeny of currently known iguanodontians is reviewed. {\copyright} 2002 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2002, 136, 113–144.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The cranial anatomy of the Lower Jurassic ornithischian dinosaur Heterodontosaurus tucki Crompton \& Charig, 1962 is described in detail for the first time on the basis of two principal specimens: the holotype (SAM-PK-K337) and referred skull (SAM-PK-K1332). In addition several other specimens that have a bearing on the interpretation of the anatomy and biology of Heterodontosaurus are described. The skull and lower jaw of Heterodontosaurus are compact and robust but perhaps most notable for the heterodont dentition that merited the generic name. Details of the cranial anatomy are revealed and show that the skull is unexpectedly specialized in such an early representative of the Ornithischia, including: the closely packed, hypsodont crowns and 'warping' of the occlusal surfaces (created by progressive variation in the angulation of wear on successive crowns) seen in the cheek dentition; the unusual sutural relationships between the bones along the dorsal edge of the lower jaw; the very narrow, deeply vaulted palate and associated structures on the side wall of the braincase; and the indications of cranial pneumatism (more commonly seen in basal archosaurs and saurischian dinosaurs). Evidence for tooth replacement (which has long been recognized, despite frequent statements to the contrary) is suggestive of an episodic, rather than continuous, style of tooth replacement that is, yet again, unusual in diapsids generally and particularly so amongst ornithischian dinosaurs. Cranial musculature has been reconstructed and seems to conform to that typically seen in diapsids, with the exception of the encroachment of M. adductor mandibulae externus superficialis across the lateral surface of the temporal region and external surface of the lower jaw. Indications, taken from the unusual shape of the occlusal surfaces of the cheek dentition and jaw musculature, are suggestive of a novel form of jaw action in this dinosaur. The taxonomy of currently known late Karoo-aged heterodontosaurids from southern Africa is reviewed. Although complicated by the inadequate nature of much of the known material, it is concluded that two taxa may be readily recognized: H. tucki and Abrictosaurus consors. At least one additional taxon is recognized within the taxa presently named Lanasaurus and Lycorhinus; however, both remain taxonomically problematic and their status needs to be further tested and may only be resolved by future discoveries. The only other named taxon, Geranosaurus atavus, represents an invalid name. The recognition of at least four distinct taxa indicates that the heterodontosaurids were speciose within the late Karoo ecosystem. The systematics of Heterodontosaurus and its congeners has been analysed, using a restricted sample of taxa. A basal (nongenasaurian) position within Ornithischia is re-affirmed. There are at least four competing hypotheses concerning the phylogenetic placement of the Heterodontosauridae, so the evidence in support of the various hypotheses is reviewed in some detail. At present the best-supported hypothesis is the one which places Heterodontosauridae in a basal (non-genasaurian) position; however, the evidence is not fully conclusive and further information is still needed in respect of the anatomy of proximate outgroups, as well as more complete anatomical details for other heterodontosaurids. Heterodontosaurids were not such rare components of the late Karoo ecosystem as previously thought; evidence also suggests that from a phylogenetic perspective they occupied a potentially crucial position during the earliest phases of ornithischian dinosaur evolution. {\copyright} 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011.}},

Albeit spectacular for their size, the skeletal anatomy of these theropods remains poorly-known, and their diversity was until recently restricted to two Cenomanian species: the highly derived Giganotosaurus carolinii, from southern South America, and the incompletely known Carcharodontosaurus saharicus, from northern Africa. Here we describe an older and basal member of the group, Tyrannotitan chubutensis gen. et sp. nov., from Aptian strata of Patagonia, Argentina. The new taxon gives new insights into the systematics and evolution of carcharodontosaurids and offers a better understanding of the evolution of Southern theropod faunas. We suggest that carcharodontosaurids radiated in Gondwana sharing with spinosaurids the role of top-predators until their extinction in Cenomanian–Turonian times. During this interval, the diplodocoid sauropods and giant titanosaurians went extinct (probably as part of a global-scale crisis), and the smaller abelisaurid theropods took dominance, reigning until the end of the Cretaceous.

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT The fragmentary skeleton of a new Late Cretaceous avialan theropod from Patagonia is described. Patagonykus puertai possesses caudal trunk vertebrae that are slightly convex caudally. The last sacral centrum is ball-shaped caudally, a condition that is also found in the caudal vertebrae. Caudal synsacral vertebrae are keeled ventrally. The hum\'{e}rus is craniocaudally compressed, and the internal tuberosity is unusually robust. Distally, the humerus has only one large subspherical condyle for articulation with the ulna and radius. The ulnar olecranon is strongly developed. The carpometacarpal is dorsoventrally compressed and quadrangular in dorsal view. Phalanx 1 of digit I has a pair of strong proximoventral hooklike processes. The ilium lacks the cranioventral fossa for the origin of the femoral protractor M. cuppedicus. The pubic pedicel of the ilium is cranioventrally oriented. The long and slender pubis is caudoventrally directed and ends distally in a massive pubic ?foot?. The presence of a deep proximal socket on the calcaneum suggests that the fibula was in articulation with the tarsus. Metatarsal III is proximally narrower than metatarsals II and IV. Patagonykus puertai is closely related to another Patagonian taxon, Alvarezsaurus calvoi, and also to the Mongolian Mononykus olecranus. Alvarezsauridae encompass these three taxa, sharing outstanding synapomorphies such as procoelous sacral and caudal vertebrae, and a stout ungual in the first digit of the manus. The Patagonian taxa are geologically older and morphologically more primitive than Mononykus olecranus. Alvarezsauridae documents a group of theropods widely distributed in late Mesozoic times, relevant to discussions of bird origins.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT several attempts have recently been made to recognize synapomorphic characters of Dinosauria. However, most of the alleged dinosaur synapomorphies show broader distributions among Archosauria, whereas other features are diagnostic to less inclusive groups than Dinosauria. With the aim to test the hypothesis supporting dinosaur monophyly, a comparative study of thirty-seven derived skeletal features in several archosaur taxa (e.g., Pterosauria, Scleromochlus, Lagerpeton, Marasuchus, Pseudolagosuchus, Saurischia, and Ornithischia) was undertaken. The monophyly of Dinosauriformes (=Marasuchus + (Pseudolagosuchus + Dinosauria)) is supported by 7 postcranial synapomorphies (e.g., proximal femur with fossa trochanterica and trochanteric shelf; cnemial crest present on proximal tibia; quadrangular distal tibia with lateral longitudinal groove). Dinosauria is diagnosed by 17 apomorphic features, such as: deltopectoral crest distally projected; at least three sacral vertebrae; perforated acetabulum; presence of brevis shelf on ilium; astragalar ascending process inserts beneath the tibia; distal tarsal 4 proximodistally depressed. The analysis suggests that a sustained modification of hindlimb morphology occurred in the early evolution of Ornithodira, since most of the diagnostic features of this and less inclusive groups (e.g., Dinosauromorpha, Dinosauriformes, and Dinosauria) pertain to the femur, tibia, tarsus, and pes. The transformation of the pelvic bones (and presumably in the musculature originating from the ilium, ischium, and pubis) was delayed with respect to the hindlimbs, since most important pelvic modifications occurred at the Dinosauria node, but not before. Forelimb transformation was not as profound as that which occurred in the hindlimbs.}},

Review of type and referred specimens of those taxa suggests that Ischisaurus and Frenguellisaurus are junior synonyms of Herrerasaurus. At present, Herrerasaurus is the only Herrerasauridae documented in the Ischigualasto Formation, and the record of a cf. Staurikosaurus in those beds is here dismissed. Cladistic analysis counters previous hypotheses supporting the outgroup position of Herrerasauridae with respect to the remaining dinosaurs. Instead, new evidence supports this group as saurischian dinosaurs: the posterior process of the jugal is forked, a hyposphene-hypantrum articulation is present in dorsal vertebrae, the distal shaft of the ischium is rod-like, and six other saurischian synapomorphies are present. Moreover, herrerasaurids share with other theropods 11 synapomorphies including prong-shaped epipophyses on the cervical vertebrae, elongate prezygapophyses in distal caudals, humerus nearly 50\% of femoral length, strongly reduced metacarpals IV and V, and distally enlarged pubis. In the context of the hypothesis accepted here, the presence of two sacral vertebrae and absence of a brevis fossa on the ilium in the Herrerasauridae are interpreted as apomorphic reversals within Dinosauria.}},

The richest Triassic dinosaur records of the southern continents are those of South America and South Africa, with taxonomically diverse faunas, whereas faunas from India and central Africa are more poorly known. Here, the known diversity of Gondwanan Triassic dinosaurs is increased with new specimens from central India, which allow a more comprehensive characterisation of these dinosaur assemblages. Five dinosauriform specimens are reported from the probable late Norian–earliest Rhaetian Upper Maleri Formation, including two new sauropodomorph species, the non-plateosaurian Nambalia roychowdhurii and the plateosaurian Jaklapallisaurus asymmetrica, a guaibasaurid and two basal dinosauriforms. The Lower Dharmaram Formation, probably latest Norian–Rhaetian in age, includes basal sauropodomorph and neotheropod remains, providing the second record of a Triassic Gondwanan neotheropod. The currently available evidence suggests that the oldest known Gondwanan dinosaur assemblages (Ischigualastian) were not homogeneous, but more diverse in South America than in India. In addition, the Upper Maleri and Lower Dharmaram dinosaur assemblages resemble purported coeval South American and European beds in the presence of basal sauropodomorphs. Accordingly, the current available evidence of the Triassic beds of the Pranhita–Godavari Basin suggests that dinosaurs increased in diversity and abundance during the late Norian to Rhaetian in this region of Gondwana.}},

Except for Unenlagia comahuensis 2, 3 and some fragmentary remains from northern Africa4, no other evidence was available on deinonychosaurian diversity in Gondwana. Here we report a new, Late Cretaceous member of the clade, Neuquenraptor argentinus gen. et sp. nov., representing uncontroversial evidence of a deinonychosaurian theropod in the Southern Hemisphere. The new discovery demonstrates that Cretaceous theropod faunas from the southern continents shared greater similarity with those of the northern landmasses than previously thought. Available evidence suggests that deinonychosaurians were probably distributed worldwide at least by the beginning of the Cretaceous period. The phylogenetic position of the new deinonychosaur, as well as other Patagonian coelurosaurian theropods, is compatible with a vicariance model of diversification for some groups of Gondwanan and Laurasian dinosaurs.}},

Its long and low snout bears numerous, small-sized conical teeth, a condition resembling spinosaurid theropods. Its short forearms depart from the characteristically long-armed condition of all dromaeosaurids and their close avian relatives. The new discovery amplifies the range of morphological disparity among unenlagiines, demonstrating that by the end of the Cretaceous this clade included large, short-armed forms alongside crow-sized, long-armed, possibly flying representatives.

The known species diversity of the ornithuromorph clade has increased rapidly with the addition of new discoveries from the Early Cretaceous deposits of northeastern China.

The specimen represents a new species, <i>Longicrusavis houi</i>, but bears similarities to <i>Hongshanornis longicresta</i> from the same formation of Inner Mongolia. The two birds are comparable in size and share an unusual sigmoid mandible and elongate hindlimbs relative to their forelimbs. Together these taxa represent a clade (Hongshanornithidae, new taxon) of specialized shorebirds whose elongate hindlimbs indicate ecological adaptations different from those of other Jehol ornithuromorphs. Phylogenetic relationships of Mesozoic birds are discussed based on the results of a comprehensive cladistic analysis. New morphological information on Ornithuromorpha is provided through the detailed description of the new taxon together with new information on <i>Hongshanornis</i>.}},

The discovery of this new specimen highlights the existence of a diverse clade of trophically specialized enantiornithines, Longipterygidae, for which we present phylogenetic support in a new comprehensive cladistic analysis of Mesozoic birds. Shanweiniao provides new information on the anatomy of longipterygids, and preserves a rectricial morphology previously unknown to enantiornithines, with at least four tail feathers closely arranged. This supports the hypothesis that enantiornithines were strong fliers and adds to the diversity of known tail morphologies of these Cretaceous birds.}},

A complete discussion of the validity of this taxon, which once included the holotype of Songlingornis, is provided, along with a revised diagnosis. The morphology of Chaoyangia is described, including extensive comparison with better known, recently discovered ornithurines as well as several other groups of Mesozoic birds (Confuciusornithiformes, Sapeornithiformes, Enantiornithes). Although preserved information is limited, the large number of fused sacral vertebrae and presence of a distal dorsal process on the ischium are among the features supporting early hypotheses that the only known specimen of Chaoyangia represents an ornithurine. Unique among ornithurines, Chaoyangia possesses two dorsal processes on the ischium, and thus remains a valid taxon. We include this taxon in a cladistic analysis to test morphological hypotheses regarding its systematic position. Although the results of the analysis are highly resolved and support the referral of Chaoyangia and Zhongjianornis to Ornithurae, support for the tree overall is very low. Recently discovered taxa have blurred the once clear morphological gap separating the two ornithothoracine clades (Ornithurae and Enantiornithes), and thus the increase in taxonomic diversity has caused a decrease in the stability of hypothetical relationships.}},

This small-bodied form deviates significantly from more typical crocodyliform craniodental morphologies, having a short, broad skull, robust lower jaw, and a dentition with relatively few teeth that nonetheless show marked heterodonty. The presence of morphologically complex, complementary upper and lower molariform teeth suggests a degree of crown–crown contact during jaw adduction that is unmatched among known crocodyliforms, paralleling the level of occlusal complexity seen in mammals and their extinct relatives7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. The presence of another small-bodied mammal-like crocodyliform in the Cretaceous of Gondwana indicates that notosuchians probably filled niches and inhabited ecomorphospace that were otherwise occupied by mammals on northern continents.}},

We present a preliminary description of the dinosaurian locality and tie it to a synthetic stratigraphic section of the Tilemsi Valley. Preliminary analysis of the geology and sedimentology of the locality suggests that the bones fossilized in fluvial deposits of Early Cretaceous (pre-Cenomanian) age.}},

The specimen exhibits a unique suite of characters in the dentition, maxilla, and dentary. A phylogenetic analysis recovers Albalophosaurus as a basal member of Ceratopsia: however, this placement is weakly supported and no unambiguous ceratopsian synapomorphies can be identified in the material. This new taxon should, therefore, be regarded as Cerapoda incertae sedis until further material is discovered. Nevertheless, Albalophosaurus offers additional information on the diversity of east Asian dinosaur faunas during the Early Cretaceous and represents only the third valid dinosaur taxon to be described from Japan.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Carcharodontosaurs were the largest predatory dinosaurs, and their early evolutionary history seems to be more intricate than was previously thought. Until recently, carcharodontosaurs were restricted to a group of large theropods inhabiting the Late Cretaceous Gondwanan land masses1, 2, but in the last few years Laurasian evidence3, 4, 5 has been causing a reevaluation of their initial diversification6. Here we describe an almost complete and exquisitely preserved skeleton of a medium-sized (roughly six metres long) theropod from the Lower Cretaceous series (Barremian stage) Konservat-Lagerst\"{a}tte of Las Hoyas7 in Cuenca, Spain. Cladistic analysis supports the idea that the new taxon Concavenator corcovatus is a primitive member of Carcharodontosauria6, exhibiting two unusual features: elongation of the neurapophyses of two presacral vertebrae forming a pointed, hump-like structure and a series of small bumps on the ulna. We think that these bumps are homologous to quill knobs present on some modern birds; the knobs are related to the insertion area of follicular ligaments that anchor the roots of the flight feathers (remiges) to the arm. We propose that Concavenator has integumentary follicular structures inserted on the ulna, as in modern birds. Because scales do not have follicles, we consider the structures anchored to the Concavenator arms to be non-scale skin appendages homologous to the feathers of modern birds. If this is true, then the phylogenetic bracket for the presence of non-scale skin structures homologous to feathers in theropod dinosaurs would be extended to the Neotetanurae, enlarging the scope for explaining the origin of feathers in theropods.}},

The diagnosis of the genus is reviewed and its phylogenetic placement within Crocodylomorpha discussed. Araripesuchus is proposed here as being the sister taxon of Neosuchia, corroborating previous phylogenetic analysis. The new species, Araripesuchus patagonicus, differs from the type species, A. gomesii in the relationships of the prefronto-nasal and lachrymo-nasal sutures, the dermal placement of the postorbital bar on the medial side of the jugal, and the greater extension of the squamosals in the skull dorsum. The African species, ?Araripesuchus? wegeneri, does not share the diagnostic traits of the genus, and its reassignment to a new genus needs to be considered. The phylogenetic context of Araripesuchus and ?A.? wegeneri permits a reanalysis of the role played by their amphiatlantic distribution in the Aptian-Albian. ?Araripesuchus? wegeneri and the South American forms might share a pre-Aptian common ancestor, and have been already differentiated and isolated in the African and South American continents by the time of the Aptian-Albian.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT The transition from basal sauropodomorphs to sauropods is one of the most dramatic evolutionary transformations in the history of dinosaurs. Constituent taxa of this transition were recorded mainly in South Africa and South America, and to a lesser extent in North America. We describe here the postcranial anatomy of four specimens of basal sauropodomorphs from the Late Triassic of Patagonia, Argentina, and identify them as adult individuals of Mussaurus patagonicus. The material is composed of one subadult and three adult specimens and was originally identified as Plateosaurus. The completeness of the material provides more complete knowledge of this taxon and allows us to introduce aspects of basal sauropodomorph anatomy that were poorly understood until now, such as the configuration and arrangement of the distal carpal elements. The phylogenetic relationships of Mussaurus patagonicus are tested through a cladistic analysis of basal sauropodomorphs based on the anatomy of these specimens rather than on the post-hatchling and juvenile specimens previously known for this taxon. Mussaurus is recovered as a non-sauropod anchisaurian, being the sister group of Aardonyx plus more derived sauropodomorphs and is depicted outside the ?quadrupedal clade,? given the presence of plesiomorphic features such as a humerus/femur ratio <0.8, a curved femoral shaft in lateral view, and a nearly circular femoral midshaft cross-section. Mussaurus patagonicus adds new and valuable information that helps to clarify the core of the basal sauropodomorph-sauropod transition.

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT A relatively diverse record of European Early Cretaceous pan-cryptodiran turtles has been revealed from the analysis of new specimens and from a review of previously defined taxa. However, knowledge about many of these taxa remains relatively limited. We erect the new taxon, Larachelus morla, gen. et sp. nov., on the basis of a shell from the late Hauterivian?early Barremian of the Iberian Range (Spain). The comparative study of this taxon with the continental European Cretaceous pan-cryptodiran representatives and cladistic analyses reveal L. morla to be a member of the little-known European Early Cretaceous stem Cryptodira. Stem cryptodirans have been recognized from the Early Cretaceous of several continents. The study of L. morla not only confirms the presence of this group in the Early Cretaceous of Europe, it also provides new insights into the European evolution of Pan-Cryptodira. This finding reveals greater diversity in European Early Cretaceous continental pan-cryptodires, highlighting its Hauterivian?Aptian record. This diversity is particularly relevant in the Iberian Range, where several clades of turtles whose coexistence has not been recognized in the Lower Cretaceous of any other region are identified: paracryptodiran members, stem cryptodiran turtles, and representatives of several lineages of the crown group Cryptodira. This very high diversity of continental taxa shows a wide range of morphological diversity that could be related to adaptation to different ecological niches.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT?The fossil snake Najash rionegrina, from the Cenomanian?Turonian (Upper Cretaceous) of Argentina, is reinterpreted after examination of the type and referred material. The current diagnosis is emended in the light of important considerations that cast doubt on the attribution of type and referred specimens (a braincase, a quadrate, and two dentary/lower jaw fragments) used to systematize this taxon. Alternative interpretations of the anatomy of the sacrum and hind limbs are proposed. Following the reevaluation of the anatomy of the type specimen and the removal from this taxon of the above-mentioned referred material, the phylogenetic position of N. rionegrina was tested in a series of maximum parsimony analyses that included all groups of extant snakes, all best-known fossil snakes (i.e., Pachyrhachis, Haasiophis, Eupodophis, Madtsoiidae, and Dinilysia), and alternative outgroups. Regardless of the outgroup used to polarize the character-state transformations, our phylogenetic analyses found no support for the hypothesis that Najash rionegrina occupies a position as the most basal snake. Depending on the outgroup, Najash is placed (1) in a position basal to all living snakes, but more derived than other fossil forms (most notably Pachyrhachis, Eupodophis, and Haasiophis); or (2) as the most basal representative of a clade of fossil snakes that is the sister group of living snakes; or (3) as the most basal representative of a clade of fossil snakes that is located between the Scolecophidia and the Alethinophidia.

Using heuristic searches conducted with the phylogenetic reconstruction program PAUP (beta version, 4.0), we found 2 trees of 98 steps (CI = 0.56). The skewness of tree length distribution reveals significant phylogenetic structure in the data. Nodes are supported by 1 to 11 character-state changes, and these character changes are sometimes reversed or paralleled elsewhere, accounting for much of the homoplasy in the reconstructions. By systematically removing both hard- and soft-part characters in separate analyses, hard-part characters were found to be far more homoplasious in their distribution across the phylogenetic tree, while soft parts are minimally homoplasious, suggesting that they are far more conservative while the hard parts are more prone to ecophenotypic variation. This phylogeny provides the basis for evaluating speciation mechanisms and the role of ecological factors in the diversification of ostracodes in this lake system.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT The aetosaur Longosuchus meadei is known from several specimens from the Upper Triassic (Carnian) of Texas. The structure of the single well preserved skull (TMM 31185-84B) was restudied in light of the appearance of new material of other archosaurs subsequent to Sawin's original (1947) description. In particular, an ossified orbitosphenoid and several structures associated with the nasolacrimal duct system are described and discussed for the first time. Adaptations for herbivory in the Aetosauria include the ventral depression of the jaw joint, the edentulous beak, and the conical, unserrated teeth in later aetosaurs. The increased ossification of the braincase may serve to protect this region during food processing, and the nasolacrimal structures probably are associated with the lateral nasal sinus system widespread in archosaurs and particularly well developed in Longosuchus. The Aetosauria are a robust monophyletic group of Suchia that can be characterized by five synapo-morphies. Aetosaurus is the most plesiomorphic aetosaur, and clades are formed by (1) Aetosauroides and Stagonolepis and (2) Longosuchus, Desmatosuchus, Typothorax, and Paratypothorax. Within the second unnamed clade, a smaller subclade consists of Typothorax and Paratypothorax.}},

Erythrosuchid monophyly can be established by their possession of a suite of seven shared derived characters. At least five valid genera of erythrosuchids can be recognized. The most plesimorphic of these is Fugusuchus from China, followed by Garjainia from Russia and Erythrosuchus from South Africa. Vjushkovia and Shansisuchus share a later common ancestry. Vjushkovia is represented by two species, V. triplicostata from Russia and V. sinensis from China. Shansisuchus, also from China, is the only erythrosuchid with two fenestrae in the antorbital region. Erythrosuchids had a nearly worldwide distribution, although individual species appear to have restricted geographical ranges. The greatest diversity is in Russia and China but this probably reflects the fact that the most complete continental sequences spanning the stratigraphic range of the erythrosuchids are known from those regions. Similarities between erythrosuchids and pseudosuchians such as Prestosuchus and Saurosuchus are the products of convergence, rather than a result of common descent.}},

The specimen lacks cranial and hind-limb elements commonly used for classification of crocodylomorphs, so character states of other features, notably armor, pelvic, tooth, and dentary morphology, are evaluated. Phylogenetic analysis of the Triassic/Jurassic non-crocodyliform crocodylomorphs (?sphenosuchians?) indicates that the new specimen is most similar to the Early Jurassic genus Sphenosuchus. Some of the features that ally the new specimen with Sphenosuchus may be artifacts of scaling, as the new specimen and the holotype of S. acutus are the two largest specimens of members of this group.}},

These features include a frontoparietal dome, an enlarged nuchal ridge that obscures the occipital region, a circular orbit, ventral curvature in the posterolaterally directed paroccipital processes, a posteroventrally directed foramen magnum, and a number of features on the braincase. The phylogenetic analysis positions Tatankacephalus with Ankylosauridae based on its sharing of several characters with other members of this clade, including an enlarged nuchal segment that obscures the occiput in dorsal view, a ventrally curving lateral profile of the cranium anterior to the orbit, pyramidal postorbital boss, laterally projecting pyramidal quadratojugal boss, the presence of a postocular shelf, the presence of paranasal sinuses, and the lack of a cingulum on a maxillary (or dentary) tooth. It is considered a basal member of Ankylosauridae because it retains premaxillary teeth and a visible lateral temporal fenestra, in contrast to the absence of premaxillary teeth and an obscured lateral temporal fenestra in younger members of this clade.}},

A gap of 30 million years has separated these early forms from the first record of terrestrial tetrapods, in the Late Vis\'{e}an (Early Carboniferous)3. Here we report the discovery of a small, highly ossified, postcranial skeleton of a terrestrially adapted, amniote-like tetrapod from the Mid Vis\'{e}an; this specimen shows the earliest known pentadactyl manus. The skeleton is associated with a gracile humerus that has a constricted shaft and exhibits torsion between proximal and distal articulations. These features are associated with the maintenance of postural support and are strong evidence of locomotion on land4. The specimen pushes back the known occurrence of terrestrial vertebrates closer to the origin of tetrapods. Phylogenetic analysis places this new animal close to undisputed amniotes occurring in the Westphalian, indicating that, by the Mid–Late Vis\'{e}an, amniotes already had a long, but previously unrecorded, history. The origin of amniotes seems to have occurred early in the Carboniferous and was part of a rapid diversification of tetrapods at this time3,5,6.}},

Avaceratops has several characters that are unique among ceratopsids though not among protoceratopsids. Plesiomorphies include: a primitive squamosal; a solid parietal; lack of a caudo-sagittal indentation on the parietal; weakly developed olecranon process of the ulna; deltopectoral crest of humerus not as distally expanded as in other ceratopsids; pointed pedal unguals; and relatively small size. A second, recently discovered partial skull that incorporates both centrosaurine and chasmosaurine characters is referred to Avaceratops. Lack of parietal fenestrae and the presence of postorbital horncores are probably basal characters within the Ceratopsidae. The inferred adult length of 4.2 m for Avaceratops is the smallest among known ceratopsids. Avaceratops is the least derived known ceratopsid, and hence is close to the ancestry of Triceratops and the Chasmosaurinae.}},

Arenysaurus is characterized by having a very prominent frontal dome; nearly vertical prequadratic (squamosal) and jugal (postorbital) processes, and deltopectoral crest of the humerus oriented anteriorly. Moreover, it possesses a unique combination of characters: short frontal (length/width approximately 0.5); midline ridge of parietal at level of the postorbital-squamosal bar; parietal excluded from the occiput; squamosal low above the cotyloid cavity. A phylogenetical analysis indicates that Arenysaurus is a rather basal member of Lambeosaurinae and the sister-taxon to Amurosaurus and the Corythosaurini-Parasaurolophini clade. The phylogenetic and biogeographical relationships of Arenysaurus and other lambeosaurines suggest a palaeogeographical connection between Asia and Europe during the Late Cretaceous.}},

  Abstract                 = {{SUMMARY Insight into the origin and early evolution of the animal phyla requires an understanding of how animal groups are related to one another. Thus, we set out to explore animal phylogeny by analyzing with maximum parsimony 138 morphological characters from 40 metazoan groups, and 304 18S rDNA sequences, both separately and together. Both types of data agree that arthropods are not closely related to annelids: the former group with nematodes and other molting animals (Ecdysozoa), and the latter group with molluscs and other taxa with spiral cleavage. Furthermore, neither brachiopods nor chaetognaths group with deuterostomes; brachiopods are allied with the molluscs and annelids (Lophotrochozoa), whereas chaetognaths are allied with the ecdysozoans. The major discordance between the two types of data concerns the rooting of the bilaterians, and the bilaterian sister-taxon. Morphology suggests that the root is between deuterostomes and protostomes, with ctenophores the bilaterian sister-group, whereas 18S rDNA suggests that the root is within the Lophotrochozoa with acoel flatworms and gnathostomulids as basal bilaterians, and with cnidarians the bilaterian sister-group. We suggest that this basal position of acoels and gnathostomulids is artifactal because for 1000 replicate phylogenetic analyses with one random sequence as outgroup, the majority root with an acoel flatworm or gnathostomulid as the basal ingroup lineage. When these problematic taxa are eliminated from the matrix, the combined analysis suggests that the root lies between the deuterostomes and protostomes, and Ctenophora is the bilaterian sister-group. We suggest that because chaetognaths and lophophorates, taxa traditionally allied with deuterostomes, occupy basal positions within their respective protostomian clades, deuterostomy most likely represents a suite of characters plesiomorphic for bilaterians.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT The study of more than 100 skeletal remains of Hispanochampsa muelleri K\"{a}lin, 1936, from the Oligocene of El Talladell (Lleida Province, Catalonia, Spain), has been decisive in revealing misinterpretations about its anatomy and phylogenetic position. Hispanochampsa muelleri is shown to be a member of the clade Diplocynodontinae, and is here considered a junior synonym of Diplocynodon. This analysis provides strong evidence for this monophyletic grouping, which is made up of the species Baryphracta deponiae, Diplocynodon darwini, Diplocynodon muelleri, D. tormis, D. ratelii, and D. hantoniensis. All of these species bear ventral osteoderms with paired ossifications, and a deep posterior tip of the iliac blade, which are synapomorphies of Diplocynodontinae. However, the interrelationships of the Diplocynodontinae remain unresolved. D. muelleri shares with D. hantoniensis, D. tormis, and D. ratelii the presence of an enlarged jugal foramen, and the particular dentary occlusion in line with the maxillary tooth row. It is highly likely that the two Spanish species, Diplocynodon muelleri and Diplocynodon tormis, were close relatives.}},

The postcanine teeth have extensive wear facets, implying an alternate unilateral occlusion and suggesting the presence of both lateral and fore-aft movement of the jaw. These characteristics appear unique within the crocodyliform lineage, showing that feeding diversity was wider than thought in this clade. The phylogenetic relationships of Sphagesaurus huenei are evaluated through a parsimony analysis. Sphagesaurus lies within a monophyletic group formed by Cretaceous and Tertiary taxa traditionally referred as notosuchians and sebecosuchians.

  Abstract                 = {{The origin of sauropod dinosaurs is one of the major landmarks of dinosaur evolution but is still poorly understood. This drastic transformation involved major skeletal modifications, including a shift from the small and gracile condition of primitive sauropodomorphs to the gigantic and quadrupedal condition of sauropods. Recent findings in the Late Triassic–Early Jurassic of Gondwana provide critical evidence to understand the origin and early evolution of sauropods. A new sauropodomorph dinosaur, Leonerasaurus taquetrensis gen. et sp. nov., is described from the Las Leoneras Formation of Central Patagonia (Argentina). The new taxon is diagnosed by the presence of anterior unserrated teeth with a low spoon-shaped crown, amphicoelous and acamerate vertebral centra, four sacral vertebrae, and humeral deltopectoral crest low and medially deflected along its distal half. The phylogenetic analysis depicts Leonerasaurus as one of the closest outgroups of Sauropoda, being the sister taxon of a clade of large bodied taxa composed of Melanorosaurus and Sauropoda. The dental and postcranial anatomy of Leonerasaurus supports its close affinities with basal sauropods. Despite the small size and plesiomorphic skeletal anatomy of Leonerasaurus, the four vertebrae that compose its sacrum resemble that of the large-bodied primitive sauropods. This shows that the appearance of the sauropod-type of sacrum predated the marked increase in body size that characterizes the origins of sauropods, rejecting a causal explanation and evolutionary linkage between this sacral configuration and body size. Alternative phylogenetic placements of Leonerasaurus as a basal anchisaurian imply a convergent acquisition of the sauropod-type sacrum in the new small-bodied taxon, also rejecting an evolutionary dependence of sacral configuration and body size in sauropodomorphs. This and other recent discoveries are showing that the characteristic sauropod body plan evolved gradually, with a step-wise pattern of character appearance.}},

The new specimens include a partially articulated postcranium associated with teeth and fragmentary remains of the mandible that allows their identification as S. icaeorhinus. This taxon was almost exclusively known from skull remains from the same stratigraphic unit and was characterized by unique cranial features such as a long, high, and narrow rostrum bearing serrated teeth. The new material reveals numerous details on the postcranial anatomy of this crocodyliform, including the presence of proportionately long limbs and 10 autapomorphies in the vertebrae, forelimb, and pelvic girdle (some of which are interpreted as adaptations to terrestriality and an erect limb posture). These features depict a highly modified postcranial anatomy for S. icaeorhinus in comparison with that of neosuchian crocodyliforms, paralleling the uniqueness of its skull anatomy. The new information is also phylogenetically informative and incorporated into a cladistic analysis that corroborates not only the close affinities of Sebecidae with Baurusuchidae (sebecosuchian monophyly), but also the deeply nested position of this clade within Notosuchia. The incorporation of postcranial characters to the phylogenetic analysis also results in a novel arrangement of the basal mesoeucrocodylians recorded in the Cretaceous?Cenozoic of Gondwana, clustering all of these species into a large monophyletic clade.}},

Zosuchus davidsoni is identifiable by numerous characters, including a posteriorly extensive secondary palate that opens through a secondary choana bordered by the palatines and pterygoids near the posterior edge of the skull, and a lacrimal–premaxillary contact on the dorsal surface of the snout. The phylogenetic relationships of Zosuchus davidsoni are shown through a parsimony analysis in the context of Crocodyliformes. This new form is found to be a late-appearing basal crocodyliform, forming a monophyletic group with two other taxa from the Early Cretaceous of China.

  Abstract                 = {{A new basal mesoeucrocodylian, Lorosuchus nodosusgen. et sp. nov., from the Palaeocene of north-western Argentina is presented here. The new taxon is diagnosed by the presence of external nares facing dorsally, completely septated, and retracted posteriorly, elevated narial rim, sagittal crest on the anteromedial margins of both premaxillae, dorsal crests and protuberances on the anterior half of the rostrum, and anterior-most three maxillary teeth with emarginated alveolar margins. This taxon is most parsimoniously interpreted as a bizarre and highly autapomorphic basal member of Sebecidae, a position supported (amongst other characters) by the elongated bar-like pterygoid flanges, a laterally opened notch and fossa in the pterygoids located posterolaterally to the choanal opening (parachoanal fossa), base of postorbital process of jugal directed dorsally, and palatal parts of the premaxillae meeting posteriorly to the incisive foramen. Lorosuchus nodosus also shares with basal neosuchians a suite of derived characters that are interpreted as convergently acquired and possibly related to their semiaquatic lifestyle. The phylogenetic analysis used for testing the phylogenetic affinities of L. nodosus depicts Sebecidae as the sister group of Baurusuchidae, forming a monophyletic Sebecosuchia that is deeply nested within Notosuchia. Alternative phylogenetic placements of Sebecidae, such as the recently proposed affinities with peirosaurids, were also evaluated within the context of the present data matrix and found to be only marginally suboptimal. {\copyright} 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 163, S7–S36.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Heterodontosauridae is a morphologically divergent group of dinosaurs that has recently been interpreted as one of the most basal clades of Ornithischia. Heterodontosaurid remains were previously known from the Early Jurassic of southern Africa, but recent discoveries and studies have significantly increased the geographical and temporal range for this clade. Here, we report a new ornithischian dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic Ca\~{n}ad\'{o}n Asfalto Formation in central Patagonia, Argentina. This new taxon, Manidens condorensis gen. et sp. nov., includes well-preserved craniomandibular and postcranial remains and represents the only diagnostic ornithischian specimen yet discovered in the Jurassic of South America so far. Derived features of its anatomy indicate that Manidens belongs to Heterodontosauridae, as the sister taxon of Heterodontosaurus and other South African heterodontosaurids. The presence of posterior dentary teeth with high crowns but lacking extensive wear facets in Manidens suggests that this form represents an intermediate stage in the development of the remarkable adaptations to herbivory described for Heterodontosaurus. The dentition of Manidens condorensis also has autapomorphies, such as asymmetrically arranged denticles in posterior teeth and a mesially projected denticle in the posteriormost teeth. At an estimated total length of 60–75 cm, Manidens furthermore confirms the small size of basal heterodontosaurids.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abelisaurids are a clade of large, bizarre predatory dinosaurs, most notable for their high, short skulls and extremely reduced forelimbs. They were common in Gondwana during the Cretaceous, but exceedingly rare in the Northern Hemisphere. The oldest definitive abelisaurids so far come from the late Early Cretaceous of South America and Africa, and the early evolutionary history of the clade is still poorly known. Here, we report a new abelisaurid from the Middle Jurassic of Patagonia, Eoabelisaurus mefi gen. et sp. nov., which predates the so far oldest known secure member of this lineage by more than 40 Myr. The almost complete skeleton reveals the earliest evolutionary stages of the distinctive features of abelisaurids, such as the modification of the forelimb, which started with a reduction of the distal elements. The find underlines the explosive radiation of theropod dinosaurs in the Middle Jurassic and indicates an unexpected diversity of ceratosaurs at that time. The apparent endemism of abelisauroids to southern Gondwana during Pangean times might be due to the presence of a large, central Gondwanan desert. This indicates that, apart from continent-scale geography, aspects such as regional geography and climate are important to reconstruct the biogeographical history of Mesozoic vertebrates.}},

The new specimen consists of an almost complete skull found in association with postcranial material. Because it is considerably more complete than the holotype, the new specimen permits proper diagnosis of Shamosuchus djadochtaensis and offers new information for exploring its phylogenetic relationships. The phylogenetic analysis conducted here improves taxon sampling of neosuchian crocodyliforms with respect to previous approaches to crocodyliform systematics and reveals that Shamosuchus djadochtaensis bears important information toward an understanding of the relationships of advanced neosuchians and the evolutionary origin of Eusuchia. Shamosuchus djadochtaensis is found to be the sister group of Rugosuchus nonganensis, comprising an Asian clade diagnosed by the presence of a sagittal ridge on the dorsal surface of the frontal, confluent openings for the exit of cranial nerves IX–XI, a posterior region of the palatine bar between suborbital fenestra that is flared posteriorly, and a longitudinal ridge on the lateral surface of the angular. This clade is inferred to be the sister group of Eusuchia, to the exclusion of Bernissartia fagesii and the Glen Rose form, based on the absence of an acute anterior tip of the frontal that wedges between the nasals, the presence of rodlike neural spines in the posterior cervical vertebrae, procoelous cervical vertebrae, and the presence of hypapophyses in the three anteriormost dorsal vertebrae. Incorporating the new information into the phylogenetic analysis indicates the decoupled nature of the evolutionary history of procoely in different regions of the vertebral column and the eusuchian type of palate, both traditionally considered as diagnostic of Eusuchia. All these features have complex evolutionary histories with several cases of convergences and reversals. Finally, a review of all the available evidence on the diversity of advanced neosuchians suggests this group achieved a worldwide distribution and a remarkable morphological diversity, pushing their evolutionary origins back to the Jurassic.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Our general understanding of hyaenodontid phylogeny and classification, particularly the division between the phylogenetically and morphologically primitive Proviverrinae and the derived Hyaenodontinae, has been fairly stable since Matthew laid down its framework in the early 20th century. However, a wealth of material described since that time allows Matthew's conclusions to be re-examined. Adding to that wealth is a new skeleton of Gazinocyon vulpeculus gen. et comb. nov. The postcranium of this specimen indicates that this animal was probably incipiently cursorial. The hindlimb morphology suggests that motion in the ankle was restricted to a parasagittal plane and that the animal was digitigrade. The forelimb is less completely preserved, making its functional ability more difficult to assess. Cladistic analysis suggests that Gazinocyon was related to a clade containing Eurotherium, Propterodon, Hyaenodon, and ?Pterodon? hyaenoides. It also suggests that Hyaenodontinae (containing Pterodon, Hyainainlouros, Hyaenodon, and ?Pterodon? hyaenoides, among others) is diphyletic. Pterodon and Hyainailouros appear to be only distantly related to Hyaenodon, losing the metaconid/(the diagnostic character of Hyaenodontinae) independently of the latter genus. Hyaenodontinae is restricted and Pterodontinae subfam. nov. is defined to reflect this hypothesis.}},

Kritosaurus is rediagnosed based on the extensive length of the dorsolateral margin of the maxilla and a unique combination of characters that includes a jugal with orbital constriction deeper than infratemporal one, infratemporal fenestra greater than orbit and with dorsal margin greatly elevated above dorsal orbital margin in adults, frontal participating in orbital margin, and paired caudal parasagittal processes of nasals resting over frontals. The taxonomy of numerous hadrosaurid specimens previously referred to Kritosaurus is reassessed; the vast majority of these cannot be positively referred to Kritosaurus. One exception is a specimen collected from the Cerro del Pueblo Formation that extends the geographical range of K. navajovius further south in Laramidia, to present-day northern Mexico. Anasazisaurus is regarded a junior synonym of Kritosaurus; their holotypes are indistinguishable from each other when considering the overlapping elements. However, many characters support distinction of Naashoibitosaurus ostromi as a valid taxon. Kritosaurus, consisting of the sister species K. navajovius and K. horneri, is deeply nested within Saurolophinae as a member of Kritosaurini. The latter clade includes also Naashoibitosaurus, Gryposaurus, and the South American Secernosaurus. Kritosaurini is characterized by a rostral nasal dorsal process not reaching the rostral margin of the narial foramen, frontal with triangular rostrolateral projection ending in a narrow apex (convergent in Brachylophosaurini), and a subrectangular dorsal region of infratemporal fenestra, among other characters. Kritosaurin hadrosaurids are hypothesized to have originated in southern Laramidia no later than the early Campanian. Subsequently, members of the clade reached northern Laramidia and South America via dispersal no later than the early and late Campanian, respectively.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract The taxonomy and phylogenetic position of the hadrosaurid dinosaur Barsboldia sicinskii is revised. This species is rediagnosed based on the unique combination of iliac central plate with depth/length ratio less than 0.8 and sacral vertebrae with distally ?clubbed? neural spines at least four times higher than their centra. A maximum parsimony analysis of 47 hadrosauroid (39 hadrosaurid) species does not support the purported lambeosaurine affinities of B. sicinskii, but recovers this form as a basal saurolophine hadrosaurid based on unambiguous synapomorphies of the ilium. This result increases the diversity of saurolophine taxa in Asia, a continent with a hadrosaurid fossil record so far dominated by lambeosaurines. Finally, several vertebral and iliac characters previously regarded as diagnostic of Lambeosaurinae are discussed and shown to be uninformative from a taxonomic or phylogenetic standpoint.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The late Cretaceous hadrosaurids were the most specialized and diverse clade of ornithopod dinosaurs. Parsimony and Bayesian methods were implemented to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships of all hadrosaurid species. Traditional and geometric morphometrics were applied to discover patterns of variation containing phylogenetic information. In total, 286 phylogenetically informative characters (196 cranial and 90 postcranial) were defined and documented: the most extensive character data set ever constructed for hadrosaurid dinosaurs. Of these, 136 characters were used for the first time in phylogenetic analysis of these ornithopods, and 93 were modified from those of other authors. Parsimony and the Bayesian analysis (using the Mk model without the gamma parameter) confirmed the split of hadrosaurids into Saurolophinae and Lambeosaurinae. Saurolophines included a major clade composed of the Prosaurolophus–Saurolophus and the Kritosaurus–Gryposaurus–Secernosaurus subclades. Edmontosaurus and Shantungosaurus were recovered outside the major clade of saurolophines. The Brachylophosaurus clade was recovered as the most basal clade of saurolophines in the parsimony analysis, whereas following the Bayesian analysis it was recovered as the sister clade to the Kritosaurus–Gryposaurus–Secernosaurus clade. These two analyses resulted in a Lambeosaurinae composed of a succession of Eurasian sister taxa to two major clades: the Parasaurolophus clade and the Hypacrosaurs altispinus–Corythosaurus clade. In contrast, the Bayesian analysis using the Mk model with the gamma parameter included, resulted in an unbalanced hadrosauroid tree, with a paraphyletic Saurolophinae, and with the Prosaurolophus clade, Edmontosaurus, and Shantungosaurus as successively closer sister taxa to Lambeosaurinae. Based on the strict reduced consensus tree derived from the parsimony analysis, Hadrosauridae was redefined as the clade stemming from the most recent common ancestor of Hadrosaurus foulkii and Parasaurolophus walkeri. {\copyright} 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2010, 159, 435–502.}},

The strict consensus of a parsimony analysis of 68 coelurosaur taxa places this theropod within Deinonychosauria with an unresolved relationship with the other members of the clade. Support for this clade was based on two unambiguous synapomorphies: maxillary dentition with at least some teeth lacking denticles anteriorly, and ungual and penultimate pedal phalanx II highly modified for hyperextension, with ungual II being more strongly curved and substantially larger than that of digit III. The finding of a new small theropod specimen in the \"{O}\"{o}sh Formation adds to the deinonychosaur fossil record from the same beds, until now restricted to the dromaeosaurid Shanag ashile.}},

  Abstract                 = {{We provide a thorough re-evaluation of the taxonomic diversity, phylogenetic relationships, and historical biogeography of the lambeosaurine hadrosaurids from the European Archipelago. Previously published occurrences of European Lambeosaurinae are reviewed and new specimens collected from upper Maastrichtian strata of the south-central Pyrenees are described. No support is found for the recognition of European saurolophines in the available hadrosaurid materials recovered so far from this area. A new genus and species of basal lambeosaurine, Canardia garonnensis, is described on the basis of cranial and appendicular elements collected from upper Maastrichtian strata of southern France. C. garonnensis differs from all other hadrosaurids, except Aralosaurus tuberiferus, in having maxilla with prominent subrectangular rostrodorsal flange; it differs from A. tuberiferus in a few maxillary and prefrontal characters. Together with A. tuberiferus, C. garonnensis integrates the newly recognized tribe Aralosaurini. Inference of lambeosaurine interrelationships via maximum parsimony analysis indicates that the other three known European lambeosaurines are representatives of two additional subclades (tribes) of these hadrosaurids: Tsintaosaurini (Pararhabdodon isonensis) and Lambeosaurini (the Arenysaurus ardevoli-Blasisaurus canudoi clade). The tribes Aralosaurini, Tsintaosaurini, Lambeosaurini, and Parasaurolophini are formally defined and diagnosed for the first time. Three event-based quantitative methods of ancestral range reconstruction were implemented to infer the historical biogeography of European lambeosaurines: Dispersal-Vicariance Analysis, Bayesian Binary MCMC, and Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis. The results of these analyses, coupled with the absence of pre-Maastrichtian lambeosaurines in the Mesozoic vertebrate fossil record of Europe, favor the hypothesis that aralosaurins and tsintaosaurins were Asian immigrants that reached the Ibero-Armorican island via dispersal events sometime during the Maastrichtian. Less conclusive is the biogeographical history of European lambeosaurins; several scenarios, occurring sometime during the Maastrichtian, are possible, from vicariance leading to the splitting of Asian or North American from European ranges to a dispersal event from North America to the European Archipelago.}},

The fact that hadrosaurids are one of the best-known clades of dinosaurs, represented by arguably the richest dinosaurian fossil record, contrasts with the scarcity of material and apparently undiagnostic nature of their type genus and species, Hadrosaurus foulkii. The holotype and only known specimen of H. foulkii is also historically significant for being the first skeletal remains of a dinosaur described outside Europe (Leidy 1858). Recently, Prieto-M\'{a}rquez et al. (2006) redescribed in detail the osteology of H. foulkii and revised the taxonomy of the genus Hadrosaurus. These authors concluded that H. foulkii is a nomen dubium because they found no autapomorphic or distinguishable characters in the type and only known materials of this taxon. Here, I show that Hadrosaurus foulkii is actually diagnosable based on a combination of plesiomorphic and derived appendicular characters. An ancilliary outcome of this study is the recognition of a diagnostic combination of iliac characters (in the context of the phylogenetic framework of Prieto-M\'{a}rquez 2010) in Claosaurus agilis, a poorly known hadrosauroid outgroup to Hadrosauridae (Fig. 1) from the middle of the North American continent.}},

The diagnosis of this taxon is emended, and the species Brachylophosaurus goodwini is now considered to be a junior synonym of Brachylophosaurus canadensis. Autapomorphies of Brachylophosaurus are: nasal greatly developed into paddle-like solid crest extending caudodorsally, overhanging dorsal region of skull; nasal possessing anteroposteriorly oriented groove terminating in elongated foramen located medial to prefrontal; prefrontal projecting posteriorly and resting dorsomedially over anterior process of postorbital and, more posteriorly, extending ventromedially under nasal; only anterior sharp tip of lacrimal contacting maxilla; jugal with ventrally projecting semicircular flange; extremely elongated, rod-like anterodorsal process of maxilla projecting medial to narial cavity along most of anteroposterior length of external naris; anteroposteriorly short exoccipital-supraoccipital roof posterior and dorsal to foramen magnum. Most autapomorphies of the junior synonym species Brachylophosaurus goodwini originated from misplacement of a nasal fragment and individual variation of the jugal. The new osteological information supports Brachylophosaurus canadensis as the sister taxon to Maiasaura peeblesorum, and suggests that the two taxa form a robust and basal clade within the Hadrosaurinae. Two new characters are discussed as phylogenetically informative for hadrosaurids: the mediolateral and anteroposterior predentary proportions and the length of the prequadratic process of the squamosal.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT The hadrosauroid dinosaur Pararhabdodon isonensis is known from partial cranial and postcranial material from the Maastrichtian of the south Pyrenean foredeep basin (northern Catalunya, Spain). We revise and emend the taxonomic history, stratigraphic context, osteology, and systematic position of this taxon. Our study leads us to rediagnose P. isonensis on the basis of a maxilla that combines an extremely elevated jugal joint with a subvertical and concave lateral surface of the maxilla ventral to the jugal joint, as well as a craniocaudally broad dorsal process; and a proximal half of the humerus medially offset 30° from its long axis. Our parsinomy heuristic analysis of P. isonensis and 22 other iguanodontoideans infers the phylogenetic position of the former as the sister taxon to Hadrosauridae (restricted here to the clade comprising Hadrosaurinae and Lambeosaurinae). One dentary, previously referred to P. isonensis, was collected at a site that is both stratigraphically and geographically separated from the type locality of P. isonensis. The dentary becomes the holotype of a new taxon, Koutalisaurus kohlerorum, on the basis of a uniquely elongated and medially projecting edentulous portion. This results in a distance between the symphysis and the lateral wall of the dentary that is three times the mediolateral breadth of the bone. K. kohlerorum shares with other hadrosauroids a tooth row that extends caudal to the apex of the coronoid process and, with Hadrosauridae, a tooth row that is, in occlusal view, straight and parallel to the lateral face of the dentary.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Hadrosaurids form the most diverse and derived clade of ornithopod dinosaurs. Although well represented in Asia and North America, its presence in South America is known only from rare and fragmentary remains that are poorly documented and mostly unstudied. As a result, the impact of these animals on the phylogenetics and biogeography of hadrosaurids as a whole is poorly known. Here, we provide a revised and complete osteology of the type specimens and hypodigms for the only two taxa known from South America, Secernosaurus koerneri and Kritosaurus australis. Likewise, we infer the phylogenetic position and historical biogeography of South American hadrosaurids using a nearly complete taxonomic sampling of hadrosaurid species. Parsimony methods were used to infer phylogenetic relationships, whereas Fitch parsimony and Dispersal-Vicariance analyses were implemented to reconstruct ancestral areas. Kritosaurus australis is regarded as a junior synonym of Secernosaurus koerneri, based on a combination of iliac and pubic characters unique to these two taxa. Inclusion of S. koerneri within the genus Kritosaurus is not supported by the phylogenetic analysis. S. koerneri is inferred to be a member of the Kritosaurus-Gryposaurus clade within Saurolophinae, as the sister taxon to the Argentinean unnamed hadrosaurid from Salitral Moreno. Another unnamed hadrosaurid from Big Bend National Park, Texas, is positioned as the closest outgroup to the South American clade. The results of this biogeographical analysis supports the hypothesis that the Secernosaurus clade originated in South America during the late Campanian after a dispersal event (probably followed by vicariance) from southern North America before the end of that geologic stage.}},

Dentary and maxillary characters previously considered as autapomorphies of K. kohlerorum and P. isonensis, respectively, are shown to be synapomorphies uniting the latter with Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus from the Campanian of the Wangshi Group, Shandong Province, China. This study provided conclusive evidence of the presence of the Lambeosaurinae in Europe. Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus and Pararhabdodon isonensis were inferred to form a clade of basal lambeosaurines characterized by a maxilla with an elevated articular facet for the jugal (continuous with the ectopterygoid ridge) and an extremely medially projected symphyseal region of the dentary. This clade originated in Asia during the middle or late Campanian. Pararhabdodon isonensis or its ancestors migrated from Asia to the Iberian island of the European archipelago. Reconstruction of ancestral areas by Fitch parsimony attributes the European occurrence of P. isonensis to a single dispersal event from Asia no later than middle to late Campanian.}},

Here, we report a nearly complete, articulated skeleton of a new basal therizinosaur from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of Jianchang County, western part of Liaoning Province, which sheds light on our understanding of anatomy of basal therizinosaurs. This new dinosaur shows some typical therizinosaur features, such as neural spines of the anterior caudal vertebrae that possess anterior and posterior alae, a rectangular buttress on the ventrolateral side of the proximal end of metacarpal I, and appressed metatarsal shafts. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that it is a basal therizinosaur (sister taxon to Therizinosauroidea) because it bears many basal therizinosaur characters in the dentition, pelvis and hind limbs. The new therizinosaur described here has unique tooth and jaw characters such as the offsetting of the tooth row by a shelf and dentary teeth with labially concave and lingually convex dentary teeth, similar to ornithopods and ceratopsians.}},

  Abstract                 = {{It is widely believed that behavior is more evolutionarily labile and/or more difficult to characterize than morphology, and thus that behavioral characters are not as useful as morphological characters for estimating phylogenetic relationships. To examine the relative utility of behavior and morphology for estimating phylogeny, we compared levels of homoplasy for morphological and behavioral characters that have been used in systematic studies. In an analysis of 22 data sets that contained both morphological and behavioral characters we found no significant difference between mean consistency indices (CIs, which measure homoplasy) within data sets for the two types of characters. In a second analysis we compared overall CIs for 8 data sets comprised entirely of behavioral characters with overall CIs for 32 morphological data sets and found no significant difference between the two types of data sets. For both analyses, 95\% confidence limits on the difference between the two types of characters indicate that, even if given the benefit of the doubt, morphological characters could not have substantially higher mean CIs than behavioral characters. These results do not support the idea that behavioral characters are less useful than morphological characters for the estimation of phylogeny.}},

The PAUP analysis shows this genus, as conventionally defined, to be polyphyletic, composed of four groups of equal taxonomie rank. Leonaspis (s.s.) is here restricted to one of these groups only, a monophyletic set of species characterised by 'four-spined' pygidia (i.e. with four spines between the major border spines) and a thorax of nine segments. Kettneraspis is recognised for the largest of these four groups, and is composed of 'two-spined' species with nine thoracic segments. Leonaspis and Kettneraspis belong to the Odontopleurinae. A third group of previous 'Leonaspis' species constitute a new genus of the Acidaspidinae. Its species are characterised by being 'four-spined' and having ten thoracic segments. For these the new genus Exallaspis is erected, with type species E. bufo. A fourth group of 'Leonaspis' species, being 'four-spined' with nine thoracic segments, belongs to Eoleonaspis, an Ordovician odontopleurine genus. Leonaspis and Exallaspis are temporally and spatially non-overlapping, Leonaspis being exclusively Gondwanan post-Wenlock, whereas Exallaspis is restricted to areas north of the Rheic Ocean and ranges from basal Llandovery to Ludlow. Kettneraspis is pandemic. The condition of five epiborder spines and ten border spines on the free cheek is proposed as plesiomorphic for odontopleurids, and the border spines are shown to originate as two separate rows with alternating spines. A shift in position of the facial suture is shown to transfer the genal spine from the cranidium to the free cheek in Kettneraspis meraspides of degree 1 or 2, and the previously suggested co-occurrence of a fixigenal and librigenal spine in these stages is refuted. Earlier proposed dimorphism is rejected, and two mechanisms for reduction in the number of pygidial border spines are proposed. Kettneraspis reetae sp. nov. is described.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract A data matrix of 32 characters, with a total of 132 character states and 48 terminal taxa of phacopid trilobites, was analysed using parsimony. The 108 most parsimonious trees have a length of 301 steps and a consistency index of 0.29. Two major clades were found, one including species referred to Acernaspis and one with species referred to Ananaspis, Paciphacops, Viaphacops, and Phacops. Most homoplasy occurs between the major clades of the trees, rather than within them. The major clades were also analysed separately, resulting in trees with significantly higher consistency indices. We redefine the following supraspecific taxa to make them monophyletic: Acernaspis, Ananaspis, and Paciphacops. In addition, Kainops, new genus, is described for a clade consisting of six taxa previously assigned to Ananaspis and Paciphacops. The evolutionary pattern resulting from our cladogram is compared with the approaches of Campbell and Eldredge, and it is argued that some of the assumptions made by these authors regarding the phylogeny of the group are not valid. The biogeography of the group was also analysed. It is found that phacopids from the Ludlow and older strata are distributed globally, with an emphasis, perhaps due to a large number of suitable localities, on Northern Europe. However, the lineage of phacopines leading up to Phacops is, with some slight exceptions, basically confined to the United States, being entirely absent in Northern Europe. The main phacopine lineage does not re-establish itself geographically until the middle Devonian. Finally, we analysed the evidence for polymorphism in phacopid trilobites, and reject this hypothesis on the basis of stratigraphy and the present cladogram.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT New material of the traversodontid cynodont Dadadon isaloi from the Triassic of southwestern Madagascar is described. The new material consists of a complete, well-preserved skull (FMNH PR 2232) and an unassociated, partial lower jaw (UA 10608). The new material reveals several novel aspects of Dadadon's morphology. Newly recognized autapomorphies that diagnose Dadadon include a fourth upper incisor with posterior accessory cusp, deep interorbital depressions confined to the frontals, and a very tall, robust mid-frontal ridge. Dadadon can further be distinguished from the similar traversodontids Massetognathus and Santacruzodon by the presence of shorter, broader prefrontals with prominent dorsal depressions, robust anterolateral processes overhanging the orbits, a single cusp in the anterior cingulum of the upper postcanines, and relatively elongate, striated, conical upper incisors. In a revised phylogenetic analysis incorporating data from the new specimens, Dadadon is recovered in a clade with Massetognathus and Santacruzodon. This clade is the sister taxon to the well-supported traversodontid subclade Gomphodontosuchinae. The ?basal Isalo II? cynodont fauna from Madagascar is more similar in composition to that of South America than to mainland Africa, although this is probably attributable to the lack of Ladinian?Carnian therapsid fossils on the mainland rather than an actual biogeographic pattern.}},

However, all theropod dinosaurs with preserved feathers reported so far are coelurosaurs. Evidence for filaments or feathers in noncoelurosaurian theropods is circumstantial and debated. Here we report an exceptionally preserved skeleton of a juvenile megalosauroid, Sciurumimus albersdoerferi n. gen., n. sp., from the Late Jurassic of Germany, which preserves a filamentous plumage at the tail base and on parts of the body. These structures are identical to the type 1 feathers that have been reported in some ornithischians, the basal tyrannosaur Dilong, the basal therizinosauroid Beipiaosaurus, and, probably, in the basal coelurosaur Sinosauropteryx. Sciurumimus albersdoerferi represents the phylogenetically most basal theropod that preserves direct evidence for feathers and helps close the gap between feathers reported in coelurosaurian theropods and filaments in ornithischian dinosaurs, further supporting the homology of these structures. The specimen of Sciurumimus is the most complete megalosauroid yet discovered and helps clarify significant anatomical details of this important basal theropod clade, such as the complete absence of the fourth digit of the manus. The dentition of this probably early-posthatchling individual is markedly similar to that of basal coelurosaurian theropods, indicating that coelurosaur occurrences based on isolated teeth should be used with caution.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Rhynchocephalians, the sister group of squamates (lizards and snakes), are only represented by the single genus Sphenodon today. This taxon is often considered to represent a very conservative lineage. However, rhynchocephalians were common during the late Triassic to latest Jurassic periods, but rapidly declined afterwards, which is generally attributed to their supposedly adaptive inferiority to squamates and/or Mesozoic mammals, which radiated at that time. New finds of Mesozoic rhynchocephalians can thus provide important new information on the evolutionary history of the group. A new fossil relative of Sphenodon from the latest Jurassic of southern Germany, Oenosaurus muehlheimensis gen. et sp. nov., presents a dentition that is unique amongst tetrapods. The dentition of this taxon consists of massive, continuously growing tooth plates, probably indicating a crushing dentition, thus representing a previously unknown trophic adaptation in rhynchocephalians. The evolution of the extraordinary dentition of Oenosaurus from the already highly specialized Zahnanlage generally present in derived rhynchocephalians demonstrates an unexpected evolutionary plasticity of these animals. Together with other lines of evidence, this seriously casts doubts on the assumption that rhynchocephalians are a conservative and adaptively inferior lineage. Furthermore, the new taxon underlines the high morphological and ecological diversity of rhynchocephalians in the latest Jurassic of Europe, just before the decline of this lineage on this continent. Thus, selection pressure by radiating squamates or Mesozoic mammals alone might not be sufficient to explain the demise of the clade in the Late Mesozoic, and climate change in the course of the fragmentation of the supercontinent of Pangaea might have played a major role.}},

Proceratosaurus is an unusual theropod with markedly enlarged external nares and a cranial crest starting at the premaxillary2013nasal junction. The skull is highly pneumatic, with pneumatized nasals, jugals, and maxillae, as well as a highly pneumatic braincase, featuring basisphenoid, anterior tympanic, basipterygoid, and carotid recesses. The dentition is unusual, with small premaxillary teeth and much larger lateral teeth, with a pronounced size difference of the serrations between the mesial and distal carina. The first dentary tooth is somewhat procumbent and flexed anteriorly. Phylogenetic analysis places Proceratosaurus in the Tyrannosauroidea, in a monophyletic clade Proceratosauridae, together with the Oxfordian Chinese taxon Guanlong. The Bathonian age of Proceratosaurus extends the origin of all clades of basal coelurosaurs back into the Middle Jurassic, and provides evidence for an early, Laurasia-wide, dispersal of the Tyrannosauroidea during the late Middle to Late Jurassic. {\\\\\\\\copyright} 2009 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2009.},

  Abstract                 = {{Sauropod dinosaurs are one of the most conspicuous groups of Mesozoic terrestrial vertebrates. They show general trends towards an overall increase in size and elongation of the neck, by means of considerable elongation of the length of individual vertebrae and a cervical vertebra count that, in some cases, increases to 19 (ref. 1). The long neck is a particular hallmark of sauropod dinosaurs and is usually regarded as a key feeding adaptation2. Here we describe a new dicraeosaurid sauropod, from the latest Jurassic period of Patagonia, that has a particularly short neck. With a neck that is about 40\% shorter than in other known dicraeosaurs3, 4, this taxon demonstrates a trend opposite to that seen in most sauropods and indicates that the ecology of dicraeosaurids might have differed considerably from that of other sauropods. The new taxon indicates that there was a rapid radiation and dispersal of dicraeosaurids in the Late Jurassic of the Southern Hemisphere, after the separation of Gondwana from the northern continents by the late Middle Jurassic.}},

Although based on an incomplete and rather poorly preserved specimen, Tugulusaurus can be shown to be valid on the basis of strongly broadened caudal vertebrae with an anteriorly placed neural arch and a short and highly asymmetrical metacarpal I. Phaedrolosaurus, based on an isolated tooth, must be considered a nomen dubium. A partial hind limb originally referred to this taxon can be demonstrated to be a distinct taxon of theropod on the basis of a posteriorly expanded fibular condyle on the proximal tibia and a longitudinal groove on the anterior side of the proximal end of the fibula. It is made the type of a new taxon, Xinjiangovenator parvus gen. et sp. nov. Whereas Tugulusaurus is the most basal coelurosaur known, Xinjiangovenator represents a maniraptoran.}},

Its placement within this basal eupelycosaur clade is supported by the presence of the following features: strongly recurved, mediolaterally flattened marginal dentition, a tall and posteroventrally enlarged temporal fenestra, a narrow lower temporal bar formed by the jugal and quadratojugal with only a small contribution from the maxilla, a long medial process of the parietal that extends far anteriorly over the orbital region, and distinctive ornamentation on three circumorbital bones. Analysis of varanopseid phylogenetic relationships indicates that Elliotsmithia is a sister taxon to the clade formed by the medium-sized North American varanopseids Varanops, Aerosaurus, and Varanodon. Elliotsmithia is unique among Paleozoic synapsids in showing evidence of supravertebral armor. Elliotsmithia is important biogeo-graphically because it is the only known Permo-Carboniferous synapsid from the Southern Hemisphere in an assemblage dominated both numerically and taxonomically by therapsids. It demonstrates that Permo-Carboniferous synapsids were not excluded ecologically by therapsids and restricted to equatorial regions during the Late Permian.}},

In addition, Eothyris and Oedaleops comprise the monophyletic Eothyrididae based on nine cranial and dental characters. In contrast to the medium to large sized herbivorous caseids, the small eothyridids exhibit dental features that indicate that they were faunivores. The presence of well-developed caniniform teeth suggests that they were predators. Both Eothyris parkeyi Romer and Oedaleops campi Langston exhibit a suite of plesiomorphic cranial characters that identify them as basal synapsids. Thus, the eothyridids are better representatives of the primitive synapsid cranial morphotype than the often-used ophiacodontids. Although they appear relatively late in synapsid evolution, both eothyridids are significantly older than all other caseasaurs, forcing the establishment of a long unrecorded lineage for caseids.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT The incompletely known sauropod Tornieria africana from the Upper Jurassic (Tithonian) of Tendaguru, Tanzania, has for over 80 years been regarded to represent a Gondwanan species of the North American genus Barosaurus Marsh (Morrison Formation: Kimmeridgian-Tithonian), but this identification has recently been questioned. The holotype and referred specimens are redescribed here, and the characters present are reevaluated in light of current knowledge of sauropod phylogeny. Synapomorphies of the skull (prefrontal with triangular posterior process) and anterior caudal vertebrae (procoelous centra, presence of diapophyseal laminae, and presence of a pleurocoel) indicate that the Tendaguru material represents a member of the Diplodocinae (Diplodocoidea, Diplodocidae) and is therefore very closely related to Barosaurus and Diplodocus. It differs from all other diplodocine genera in several characters, such as robust anterior caudals with pleurocoels located in the upper third of the centrum and ventral excavations, and stout hind limb proportions similar to Apatosaurus (tibia:femur length ratio less than 0.64). In a phylogenetic analysis, the African form consistently emerges as the sister taxon to Barosaurus+Diplodocus. Therefore, previous suggestions that Tornieria africana is the available name for this taxon are supported by this analysis. The existence of this form in Gondwana contradicts the idea of Laurentian endemism of the diplodocid clade, and is best explained by a vicariance model of diplodocoid paleobiogeography. This implies an extensive ghost lineage of this group, extending back at least as far as the upper Middle Jurassic.}},

It is characterized by its small size and its striking similarity to Sphenodon. The presence of a deep posteromedial wear facet on the caniniform tooth, a small denticle in the additional tooth series, and an anterior small groove dorsal and convergent to the Meckelian Canal, are unique characteristics of this species. In adult individuals the caniniform tooth placed posteriorly to an edentulous ridge, and the presence of wear facets on teeth and jaws caused by propalinal jaw action, suggest that C. huizachalensis is closely related to Sphenodon; the wear facet on the posteromedial face of the caniniform tooth, however, may suggest a different arrangement of the anterior palatal region.}},

A phylogenetic analysis of its relationships supports the hypothesis that it is among the closest relatives of the only extant sphenodontian, Sphenodon. However, the relationships of Z. ejidoensis could not be resolved with respect to Eilenodontinae, Opisthias, and a Cynosphenodon-Sphenodon clade.

Parsimony analysis rejects the monophyly of the Placodontoidea, and places Paraplacodus at the root of the placodont tree, as the sister-taxon of all the other representatives of the clade.

In comparison to its sister-group (Cymatosaurus), the Nothosauridae are characterized by an extreme dorsoventral flattening of the temporal region of the skull. This is correlated with the development of an occipital flange on the squamosal and parietal, allowing posterodorsal expansion of the jaw adductor musculature.

  Abstract                 = {{Pachypleurosaur material from the Middle Triassic `Grenzbitumen'-horizon (Anis-Ladin boundary) of Monte San Giorgio, Kanton Tessin, Switzerland, is described as a new genus and species, Serpianosaurus mirigiolensis. A detailed morphological description is followed by a quantitative analysis. The taxon differs from other pachypleurosaurids primarily by its relatively large skull and its straight lower jaw. Rib pachyostosis is absent. In most characters the taxon remains plesiomorphous with respect to other pachypleurosaurs from the Middle Triassic deposits of Monte San Giorgio, which accords well with its early stratigraphic occurrence at that locality. Sexual dimorphism is expressed by the size and shape of the humerus. A cladistic analysis shows the Pachypleurosauridae to constitute the sistergroup of all other Sauropterygia. The Sauropterygia and the Placodontia together form a monophyletic group, the Euryapsida, which is subordinated to the Diapsida and to the Neodiapsida, but which is classifed outside the archosauromorph-lepidosauromorph dichotomy within the Neodiapsida. A concluding paragraph discusses the status of the pachypleurosaurs within the Sauropterygia. Skull structure, and jaw mechanics in particular, suggest a relatively plesiomorph position of pachypleurosaurs within the Sauropterygia. Their adaptation to an aquatic mode of life was not carried to the degree observed in other sauropterygians, and the ability for rapid and deep dives seems to have been limited by middle-ear structure.}},

Within the Cyamodontoidea, Henodus is the most basal clade in one tree, a crown?group cyamodontoid (the sister?taxon of Placochelys) in the second tree. Cyamodus is the sister?taxon of a clade comprising Placochelys and Psephoderma in the first tree, and is the most basal cyamodontoid clade in the second tree. The second tree is provisionally accepted because of the late appearance of Henodus in the fossil record of placodonts. The significance of these findings for the reconstruction of the paleobiogeographical history of the group is discussed.}},

Fossils of A. meridionale are the first record of an anthracothere from the New World Tropics. Among anthracotheres, A. meridionale is most similar to A. acridens from the middle Arikareean from Texas in having a relatively deep and robust jaw, high and sharp cusps on the lower molars, short c?p1 diastema, and absence of a mesiolingual metacristid. A. meridionale differs from other species in being generally larger, two lower incisors (rather than three), prehypocristid never reaching the postprotocristid, more apical junction between postprotocristid and postmetacristid, mesiolingual entocristid transversely notching preentocrisitid, and transverse valley tapered lingually by prehypocristid. Although cladistic analysis of 28 anthracotheriids coded for 51 characters supports a relationship between A. meridionale and A. acridens, some presumably convergent dental characteristics are also similar to certain Oligocene-Miocene Eurasian bothriodontines. The presence of Arretotherium in the Las Cascadas Formation in Panama, and absence in the later Centenario Fauna, shows that primitive bothriodontines entered into Central America by the early Miocene before disappearing from the New World during the late early?middle Miocene.

Based on external morphological characters, primarily characters of the carapace and appendages, the crayfish comprise a monophyletic group (Astacida). The sister taxon to the crayfish is the Chilenophoberidae, a clade of extinct marine lobsters. Synapomorphies of the freshwater crayfish include a distinctive carapace groove pattern and mobility of the last thoracic segment. Within the Astacida, three smaller clades, considered to be family-level groups, are identified and redefined. All parastacid genera except Gramastacus comprise a monophyletic clade. Species in the Cambaridae are characterized by an apomorphous annulus ventralis in the female, and hooks on the ichiopodites on the third pereiopod in the male. Species in the Astacidae are characterized by randomly arranged tubercules on the medial portion of dactyl. The monophyly of the Astacoidea (Cambaridae plus Astacidae) is also supported. The familial affinity of Cambaroides is questioned, and this genus is tentatively reassigned from the Cambaridae to the Astacidae.}},

Results of the phylogenetic analysis show that the suborders Ceratiocaridina Clarke inZittel, 1900, and Rhinocaridina Hall and Clarke, 1888, are paraphyletic as traditionally defined. The diagnoses of these suborders are revised and the use of the suborders Echinocaridina Clarke inZittel, 1900, and Pephricaridina Van Straelen, 1933, is proposed. Ceratiocaridina now contains the family Ceratiocarididae Salter, 1860; Rhinocaridina contains the family Rhinocarididae Hall and Clarke, 1888; Echinocaridina includes the families Aristozoidae G\"{u}rich, 1929, Ptychocarididae n. fam., and Echinocarididae Clarke inZittel, 1900; Pephricaridina includes the families Pephricarididae Van Straelen, 1933, and Ohiocarididae Rolfe, 1962. Generic definitions within the Rhinocarididae, in particular ?Rhinocaris? Clarke inHall and Clarke, 1888, are revised. The genus Echinocaris is redefined to include a monophyletic assemblage of species. Each of these clades is supported by several synapomorphies. Two new genera, Paraechinocaris and Carinatacaris, are proposed. Biogeographic analysis of this group reveals an extremely low rate of vicariant speciation, while episodes of range expansion are frequent. All occurrences of vicariance preceded the Late Devonian mass extinction. This may suggest a relationship between increased dispersal, diminished speciation, and the Late Devonian biotic crisis. Parallels between the Late Devonian mass extinction and the modern biodiversity crisis are suggested by the frequency of episodes of range expansion indicative of invasive species.}},

This modification is characterized by an intermediate semi-procoelous condition in which the posterior condyle is dimpled by a concavity. Pachycheilosuchus differs from all known crocodyliforms in having an expanded maxillary margin that displaces the tooth row medially, and in possessing a cervical shield formed by the complete fusion of six osteoderms. Phylogenetic analysis indicates a sister taxon relationship with the weakly defined Atoposauridae. The presence of variable procoely in both Pachycheilosuchus and the closely related atoposaurid Theriosuchus indicates convergent evolution of the character with Eusuchia. Sediments at the locality were deposited in near-shore, marine-to-brackish waters, suggesting that Pachycheilosuchus inhabited euryhaline marine environments.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract Phylogenetic reconstructions of two tropical American venerid genera, Chione and Chionopsis (subfamily Chioninae) were attempted at the species-level. The purposes of the analyses were to provide historical reconstructions of origination and extinction events in the two clades, as well as patterns of invasion and diversification. The analyses were based entirely on conchological characters to facilitate the inclusion of a substantial number of fossil taxa, but difficulties were encountered due to the quality of preservation and availability of material. Nevertheless the two genera were established as monophyletic clades, and the reconstructions yielded considerable insight into their histories in tropical America. The analyses suggest that both genera originated in the tropical western Atlantic, Chionopsis by at least the early Oligocene, and Chione in the early Miocene. Various branches of both genera subsequently invaded the tropical eastern Pacific several times prior to Seaway closure, with only one possible reciprocal invasion of the western Atlantic. Pliocene extinction affected both genera more significantly in the western Atlantic relative to the eastern Pacific, and diversity is higher today in the latter region. These conclusions are not entirely consistent with the fossil records of the genera, but this incongruency highlights the need for much more extensive sampling of the eastern Pacific Cenozoic record.}},

This taxon corresponds to a new species clearly different from Asfaltomylos patagonicus from the same locality and stratigraphic level. This new species is based on three lower jaws with relatively well-preserved dentition. The lower jaw shows a primitive morphology having a Meckelian groove, a prominent medial flange associated with a lateral ridge of the dentary, and a deep dentary trough, which possibly indicates the presence, even though reduced, of postdentary bones still attached to the dentary. The lower dental formula is i4, c1, p5, m3. The premolars are simple, bearing a main cusp, while the molars appear to be tribosphenic, with an obtuse to right-angled trigonid and a basined talonid with three cusps. This association of plesiomorphic features in the jaw and derived features in the molars is documented in several taxa of the recently proposed Australosphenida. A phylogenetic analysis of mammaliaforms nests the new species with Asfaltomylos from the same locality and stratigraphic level; Henosferidae, new family, is recognized for Asfaltomylos and Henosferus, representing the basal radiation of Australosphenida. Henosferidae is the sister group to Ambondro from the Middle Jurassic of Madagascar, which, in agreement with previous phylogenies, is the sister taxon to the remaining australosphenidans. Additionally, our phylogenetic analysis does not support the inclusion of australosphenidans within eutherians. Henosferids likely retained some connection of the postdentary elements with the dentary; therefore, if the inclusion of Monotremata within Australosphenida is confirmed, final freeing of the postdentary elements and development of a tri-ossicular middle ear would be convergent events in Monotremata and Theria. Finally, the distinctiveness of the yet sparse South American record of Jurassic mammals when compared with the slightly better documented Cretaceous data is emphasized. The clear faunistic break between the Middle Jurassic and Early/Late Cretaceous underlies our rudimentary understanding of the evolution of Mesozoic mammals in Gondwana.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Sauropodomorph dinosaurs originated in the Southern Hemisphere in the Middle or Late Triassic and are commonly portrayed as spreading rapidly to all corners of Pangaea as part of a uniform Late Triassic to Early Jurassic cosmopolitan dinosaur fauna. Under this model, dispersal allegedly inhibited dinosaurian diversification, while vicariance and local extinction enhanced it. However, apomorphy-based analyses of the known fossil record indicate that sauropodomorphs were absent in North America until the Early Jurassic, reframing the temporal context of their arrival. We describe a new taxon from the Kayenta Formation of Arizona that comprises the third diagnosable sauropodomorph from the Early Jurassic of North America. We analysed its relationships to test whether sauropodomorphs reached North America in a single sweepstakes event or in separate dispersals. Our finding of separate arrivals by all three taxa suggests dispersal as a chief factor in dinosaurian diversification during at least the early Mesozoic. It questions whether a 'cosmopolitan' dinosaur fauna ever existed, and corroborates that vicariance, extinction and dispersal did not operate uniformly in time or under uniform conditions during the Mesozoic. Their relative importance is best measured in narrow time slices and circumscribed geographical regions.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Up to now, more than 40 dinosaur sites have been found in the latest Jurassic – earliest Cretaceous sedimentary outcrops (Villar del Arzobispo Formation) of Riodeva (Iberian Range, Spain). Those already excavated, as well as other findings, provide a large and diverse number of sauropod remains, suggesting a great diversity for this group in the Iberian Peninsula during this time. Vertebrae and ischial remains from Riodevan site RD-13 are assigned to Turiasaurus riodevensis (a species described in RD-10, Barrihonda site), which is part of the Turiasauria clade. This is the first time that a taxon is attributed to Turiasaurus genus out of its type site. A Neosauropod caudal vertebra from the RD-11 site has been classified as Diplodocinae indet., supporting the previous attribution on an ilion also found in Riodeva (CPT-1074) referring to the Diplodocidae clade. New remains from the RD-28, RD-41 and RD-43 sites, of the same age, among which there are caudal vertebrae, are assigned to Macronaria. New sauropod footprints from the Villar del Arzobispo Formation complete the extraordinary sauropod record coming to light in the area. The inclusion of other sauropods from different contemporaneous exposures in Teruel within the Turiasauria clade adds new evidence of a great diversity of sauropods in Iberia during the Jurassic–Cretaceous transition. Turiasauria distribution contributes to the understanding of European and global palaeobiogeography.}},

Skull material of the holotypic individual was discovered in close association. Comparisons with other sauropods suggest that the Turiasaurus skull most closely resembled those of Jobaria, Camarasaurus and Mamenchisaurus youngi, possessing large spatulate teeth, enlarged and partially retracted external nares, and a broadly rounded muzzle. The list of autapomorphies for Turiasaurus is augmented by the new cranial data, including features such as: (1) a shelf-like projection of bone from the medial surface of the distal end of the maxillary ascending process; and (2) a rounded boss-like area on the lateral surface of the jugal. There are also unusual character states, such as the excavation of the posterior surfaces of the basal tubera (present in Turiasaurus and Losillasaurus) that probably have a wider phylogenetic significance. Phylogenetic analyses, using two different datasets, support the view that Turiasaurus, Losillasaurus and Galveosaurus form a monophyletic Turiasauria clade that lies just outside of Neosauropoda. The addition of the new cranial data slightly strengthens the support for this topology, but the relationships of other taxa (such as Jobaria) become less stable. The Turiasauria might represent a distinct group of non-neosauropods with a wide geographic distribution across Europe and Africa during the Late Jurassic.}},

Pachydectes elsi n. gen. and sp. is distinguished from all other therapsids by its possession of a conspicuous pachyostotic maxillary boss that sheathes the root of the upper canine. It shares the presence of a preparietal ossification with other biarmosuchians and a pachyostotic boss below the postorbital bar with other burnetiamorphs. Pachydectes is the first burnetiamorph known from along the Ecca-Beaufort contact in the eastern part of the Karoo Basin and only the second burnetiamorph to be described from the Tapinocephalus Assemblage Zone. All other South African burnetiamorphs, save Bullacephalus jacksoni, are known from much younger biozones of the Beaufort Group. Our phylogenetic analysis links Pachydectes and Bullacephalus, which are the stratigraphically lowest-occurring taxa, with Burnetia, the burnetiamorph known from the highest position in the lower Beaufort Group. This result suggests that most of the history of biarmosuchians in South Africa is unrecorded.}},

Also from the late Cretaceous, an ornithopod vertebra, a pair of theropod teeth and one tarsometatarsus of a gaviiform bird (Neogaeornis wetzeli Lambrecht) have been reported. The Cenozoic fossil record comprises abundant and well preserved marine birds from Eocene and Miocene units, with a specially abundant record of Sphenisciformes and less frequently, Procellariiformes. There is an excellent Miocene-Pliocene record of other birds such as Odontopterygiformes, including the most complete skeleton ever found of a pelagornithid, Pelagornis chilensis Mayr and Rubilar-Rogers. Fossil birds are also known from Pliocene and Pleistocene strata. A remarkable collection of birds was discovered in lacustrine sediments of late Pleistocene age associated to human activity. The perspectives in the study of dinosaurs in Chile are promising because plenty of material stored in institutional collections is not described yet. The record of Chilean dinosaurs is relevant for understanding the dynamics and evolution of this group of terrestrial animals in the western edge of Gondwana, while Cenozoic birds from the Region may contribute to the understanding of current biogeography for instance, the effect of the emergence and establishment of the Humboldt Current. \^{a}º This is the most complete review on the dinosaur fossil record of Chile. \^{a}º A critical review is highly relevant as reference for future studies in this field. \^{a}º Including the most complete pelagornithid ever found in the world. \^{a}º New information on the first non-avian species described in the country. \^{a}º Its relevant for understanding the animal evolution in the western edge of Gondwana.}},

A skeletal reconstruction generally resembles that of a moderately large prosauropod with long arms and a short tail. However, in its detailed morphology the reptile appears to be close to the ancestry of the Therizinosauridae Maleev, 1954 (for which Segno-sauridae Perle, 1979 is probably a junior synonym). These theropods are best referred to the Tetanurae of Gauthier, 1986. However, a provisional analysis of the distribution of therizinosauroid characters within tetanurans suggests the existence of two subordinate groups: the Carnosauria (Allosaurus, dromaeosaurids, and tyrannosaurids) and the Oviraptorosauria (including therizinosauroids, ornithomimids, troodontids, and oviraptorids).}},

  Abstract                 = {{An articulated neck of a large, mature sauropod, with enormously elongated cervical ribs, was discovered in strata of Late Jurassic age in the eastern Junggar Basin, Xinjiang, People's Republic of China. The animal is estimated to have originally measured 26?m in length, but was lightly proportioned relative to Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. Rudimentary spines on the anteriormost cervical vertebrae diagnose a previously undescribed species of Mamenchisaurus. Cranial parts associated with the neck do not support a close relationship with diplodocids. Mamenchisaurs apparently belong to an endemic Jurassic radiation of Asian sauropods.}},

The revised diagnosis and redescription of Perryella provide the basis for a re-evaluation of its systematic affinities. A cladistic analysis of (mostly) Carboniferous and Permian temnospondyls, together with several Devonian and Carboniferous stem tetrapod outgroups, supports a single origin for temnospondyls. The sequence of branching events within temnospondyls consists of: (1) a paraphyletic Edopoidea; (2) a clade of Zatracheidae, Eryopidae, and basal Archegosauriformes; (3) a monophyletic Dvinosauria; and (4) a monophyletic Dissorophoidea. Perryella is nested within Dvinosauria in an intermediate position between Trimerorhachidae and Dvinosauroidea.}},

A remarkably well preserved humerus in extensor view shows similarities with humeri of immature specimens of the embolomere Proterogyrinus. A new cladistic analysis, built from combining characters used in two recent matrices, places Silvanerpeton in a basal position relative to embolomeres and more derived stem amniotes. Data from Silvanerpeton inform character polarity near the base of the amniote total group. We discuss some morphofunctional implications of character changes at the root of total group amniotes, acquisition of terrestrial habits, and patterns of early disparity in this clade.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Extant amphibians consist of Salientia (frogs), Caudata (salamanders), and Gymnophiona (caecilians). The mutual relationships of these groups are controversial, with either Batrachia (Salientia + Caudata) or Procera (Gymnophiona + Caudata) as emerging clades in recent molecular and morphological analyses. The monophyly of amphibians as a whole is supported by independent data, but their origins and affinities with early tetrapods are debated. A new cladistic analysis of early tetrapods retrieves Temnospondyli (the most species-rich group of early tetrapods) as the closest relatives of crown group amphibians. One temnospondyl group, the Dissorophoidea, forms a series of consecutive outgroups to crown amphibians. In particular, the Lower Permian amphibamid Doleserpeton is the most derived plesion on the amphibian stem. The Albanerpetontidae, a group of salamander-like tetrapods ranging from the Jurassic to the Pliocene, are placed as stem Gymnophiona. The shortest trees support the Batrachia hypothesis. However, the Procera hypothesis is not a significantly worse fit for the whole character set. Exhaustive treatment of characters and taxa is the most appropriate way to disentangle contrasting phylogenetic signals in large matrices. Tests of different crown topologies show that placement of amphibians within lepospondyls (e.g. as sister taxon to Lysorophia) is not a significantly worse fit for the whole character set than a close temnospondyl\&ndash;lissamphibian relationship. However, the latter phylogenetic hypothesis best captures the most coherent assembly of derived lissamphibian apomorphies.}},

  Abstract                 = {{In an attempt to investigate differences between the most widely discussed hypotheses of early tetrapod relationships, we assembled a new data matrix including 90 taxa coded for 319 cranial and postcranial characters. We have incorporated, where possible, original observations of numerous taxa spread throughout the major tetrapod clades. A stem-based (total-group) definition of Tetrapoda is preferred over apomorphy- and node-based (crown-group) definitions. This definition is operational, since it is based on a formal character analysis. A PAUP* search using a recently implemented version of the parsimony ratchet method yields 64 shortest trees. Differences between these trees concern: (1) the internal relationships of a\"{i}stopods, the three selected species of which form a trichotomy; (2) the internal relationships of embolomeres, with Archeria crassidisca and Pholiderpeton scutigerum collapsed in a trichotomy with a clade formed by Anthracosaurus russelli and Pholiderpeton attheyi; (3) the internal relationships of derived dissorophoids, with four amphibamid species forming an unresolved node with a clade consisting of micromelerpetontids and branchiosaurids and a clade consisting of albanerpetontids plus basal crown-group lissamphibians; (4) the position of albenerpetontids and Eocaecilia micropoda, which form an unresolved node with a trichotomy subtending Karaurus sharovi, Valdotriton gracilis and Triadobatrachus massinoti; (5) the branching pattern of derived diplocaulid nectrideans, with Batrachiderpeton reticulatum and Diceratosaurus brevirostris collapsed in a trichotomy with a clade formed by Diplocaulus magnicornis and Diploceraspis burkei. The results of the original parsimony run – as well as those retrieved from several other treatments of the data set (e.g. exclusion of postcranial and lower jaw data; character reweighting; reverse weighting) – indicate a deep split of early tetrapods between lissamphibian- and amniote-related taxa. Colosteids, Crassigyrinus, Whatcheeria and baphetids are progressively more crownward stem-tetrapods. Caerorhachis, embolomeres, gephyrostegids, Solenodonsaurus and seymouriamorphs are progressively more crownward stem-amniotes. Eucritta is basal to temnospondyls, with crown-lissamphibians nested within dissorophoids. Westlothiana is basal to Lepospondyli, but evidence for the monophyletic status of the latter is weak. Westlothiana and Lepospondyli form the sister group to diadectomorphs and crown-group amniotes. Tuditanomorph and microbrachomorph microsaurs are successively more closely related to a clade including proximodistally: (1) lysorophids; (2) Acherontiscus as sister taxon to adelospondyls; (3) scincosaurids plus diplocaulids; (4) urocordylids plus a\"{i}stopods. A data set employing cranial characters only places microsaurs on the amniote stem, but forces remaining lepospondyls to appear as sister group to colosteids on the tetrapod stem in several trees. This arrangement is not significantly worse than the tree topology obtained from the analysis of the complete data set. The pattern of sister group relationships in the crownward part of the temnospondyl-lissamphibian tree re-emphasizes the important role of dissorophoids in the lissamphibian origin debate. However, no specific dissorophoid can be identified as the immediate sister taxon to crown-group lissamphibians. The branching sequence of various stem-group amniotes reveals a coherent set of internested character-state changes related to the acquisition of progressively more terrestrial habits in several Permo-Carboniferous forms.}},

The material can be assigned to Centrosaurinae based on features of the preserved squamosal. Although the parietals are incomplete, the shape of the diagnostic parietal can be inferred from several overlapping serial elements. The parietal of the new taxon shares with all other centrosaurines, except Centrosaurus apertus, spike-like ornamentation at the posterolateral (P3) locus under traditional coding methods. At approximately 78 Ma, it is the oldest known Canadian ceratopsid, approximately 0.5 Ma older than Albertaceratops from the lower Oldman Formation of Canada and approximately 1.0 Ma younger than Diabloceratops from the Wahweap Formation of Utah. A phylogenetic analysis resolves the new taxon as the basalmost centrosaurine and places Centrosaurus brinkmani as the sister taxon to Styracosaurus albertensis. The type species of Centrosaurus brinkmani is moved to a new genus.}},

This species is restricted to the Oldman Formation of southern Alberta and is the oldest ceratopsid represented by diagnostic material in Canada.

  Abstract                 = {{It is commonly believed that there are differences in the evolutionary lability of the crania, dentition, and postcrania of mammals, the latter two being more prone to homoplasy because of strong selective pressures for feeding and locomotion, respectively. Further, because of the fragmentary nature of fossils, phylogenetic analyses of extinct taxa often must utilize characters based on only one of these systems. In this paper the levels of homoplasy (as measured by the consistency index; CI) were compared in characters based on these three anatomical systems in therian mammals. No statistically significant differences were found in the overall CIs of 41 data sets based on dental, cranial, or postcranial characters. Differences in homoplasy within data sets with two or three kinds of data were not statistically significant. These findings suggest that dental, cranial, and postcranial characters can be equally prone to homoplasy and none should be automatically dismissed, disregarded, or systematically weighted in phylogenetic analyses. The level of homoplasy in characters derived from a given region of the skeleton may differ depending on the taxonomic level of the taxa considered. Dental, cranial, and postcranial characters may not constitute ” natural” classes, yet examination of the phylogenetic signal of these subsets of data previous to a simultaneous analysis can shed light on significant aspects of the evolutionary process.}},

Eusuchia includes the crown group Crocodylia, which comprises Crocodyloidea, Alligatoroidea and Gavialoidea. Fossils of non-crocodylian eusuchians are currently rare and, in most instances, fragmentary. Consequently, the transition from Neosuchia to Crocodylia has been one of the most poorly understood areas of crocodyliform evolution. Here we describe a new crocodyliform from the mid-Cretaceous (98–95 Myr ago; Albian–Cenomanian) Winton Formation of Queensland, Australia, as the most primitive member of Eusuchia. The anatomical changes associated with the emergence of this taxon indicate a pivotal shift in the feeding and locomotor behaviour of crocodyliforms—a shift that may be linked to the subsequent rapid diversification of Eusuchia 20 Myr later during the Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary. While Laurasia (in particular North America) is the most likely ancestral area for Crocodylia, the biogeographic events associated with the origin of Eusuchia are more complex. Although the fossil evidence is limited, it now seems likely that at least part of the early history of Eusuchia transpired in Gondwana.}},

E. procurvicornis is known from three skulls and numerous cranial and postcranial elements from two bonebed assemblages. A. horneri is based on three skulls, one with associated postcranial elements. A phylogenetic review of the subfamily Centrosaurinae reveals two clades, one containing Centrosaurus and Styracosaurus and the other Pachyrhinosaurus plus the two new taxa from Montana. Diagnostic traits for resolving within-group relationships are found only in the skull roof in association with what appear to be secondary sexual characters, probably the result of sexual selection. In addition to illuminating the pattern of ceratopsian evolution, these taxa suggest an increased rate of evolution that may correlate with the late Campanian transgression of the Bearpaw Sea.}},

The western landmass, known as Laramidia, although diminutive in size, witnessed a major evolutionary radiation of dinosaurs. Other than hadrosaurs (duck-billed dinosaurs), the most common dinosaurs were ceratopsids (large-bodied horned dinosaurs), currently known only from Laramidia and Asia. Remarkably, previous studies have postulated the occurrence of latitudinally arrayed dinosaur \^{a}€{{\oe}}provinces,\^{a}€� or \^{a}€{{\oe}}biomes,\^{a}€� on Laramidia.

  Abstract                 = {{The fossil record of centrosaurine ceratopsids is largely restricted to the northern region of western North America (Alberta, Montana and Alaska). Exceptions consist of single taxa from Utah (Diabloceratops) and China (Sinoceratops), plus otherwise fragmentary remains from the southern Western Interior of North America. Here, we describe a remarkable new taxon, Nasutoceratops titusi n. gen. et sp., from the late Campanian Kaiparowits Formation of Utah, represented by multiple specimens, including a nearly complete skull and partial postcranial skeleton. Autapomorphies include an enlarged narial region, pneumatic nasal ornamentation, abbreviated snout and elongate, rostrolaterally directed supraorbital horncores. The subrectangular parietosquamosal frill is relatively unadorned and broadest in the mid-region. A phylogenetic analysis indicates that Nasutoceratops is the sister taxon to Avaceratops, and that a previously unknown subclade of centrosaurines branched off early in the group's history and persisted for several million years during the late Campanian. As the first well-represented southern centrosaurine comparable in age to the bulk of northern forms, Nasutoceratops provides strong support for the provincialism hypothesis, which posits that Laramidia—the western landmass formed by inundation of the central region of North America by the Western Interior Seaway—hosted at least two coeval dinosaur communities for over a million years of late Campanian time.}},

Die \"{a}ltesten Ichthyosauier aus der oberen Untertrias (Spath) zeigen schon einen besonderen Satz von Merkmalen (sehr gro{\ss}e Augen, verl\"{a}ngerte Schnauze, tief amphicoele Wirbel, zu Flossen umgebildete Beine), die mit ihrer vollaquatischen Lebensweise zusammenh\"{a}ngen, und sie waren vermutlich schon nicht mehr zum Landgang f\"{a}hig. Die Schl\"{u}sselinovation der Ichthyosaurier war das Lebendgeb\"{a}ren, das im Fossilbericht seit dem Ende des Anis belegt ist. Wichtige Evolutionstrends im Bewegungsapparat sind die zunehmende Modifikation des Flossenskelettes zu einem Mosaik von gleichartigen, abgeflachten Knochen und der Wechsel vom anguiliformen Schwimmen zum thunniformen Schwimmen bei den jurassischen und sp\"{a}teren Formen. Diese zeichnen sich durch eine Verk\"{u}rzung des K\"{o}rpers und die Entwicklung einer halbmondf\"{o}rmigen Schwanzflosse aus. Fast von Anfang an hatten die Ichthyosaurier eine weltweite Verbreitung, die sie auch bis zu ihrem Aussterben im Cenoman beibehielten. Die Vielfalt der Ichthyosaurier ist in der Mitteltrias am gr\"{o}{\ss}ten, als es sowohl rein piscivore Formen gab, als auch solche mit heterodontem Gebi{\ss} und mit Knackgebi{\ss}. Im Jura ist die Diversit\"{a}t im Lias am h\"{o}chsten, in der Kreide reduziert sie sich aber auf eine Gattung (Platypterygius). Obwohl Sch\"{a}delmerkmale die Ichthyosaurier als Diapsiden ausweisen, ist ihre genaue Stellung innerhalb dieser Gruppe unklar. Eine computergest\"{u}tzte kladistische Analyse der gut bekannten Gattungen erhellt dagegen die Verwandschaftsbeziehungen innerhalb der Gruppe: Die basalsten Formen sindGrippia undUtatsusaurus, gefolgt von den Mixosauridae (Mixosaurus undPhalarodon). Die Shastasauriden (Cymbospondylus, Shonisaurus, Besanosaurus) sind die fortschrittlichsten Triasformen und stellen die Schwestergruppe aller posttriassischer Ichthyosaurier dar. Letztere sind eindeutig monophyletisch und werden hier mit dem Namen Neoichthyosauria belegt.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Ichthyosaurs were an important group of Mesozoic marine reptiles and existed from the Early Triassic to the early Late Cretaceous. Despite a great diversity in body shapes and feeding adaptations, all share greatly enlarged eyes, an elongated rostrum with numerous conical teeth, and a streamlined body. Based on new material from China and the restudy of Shastasaurus pacificus, we here reinterpret the classical large-bodied Late Triassic ichthyosaur genus Shastasaurus to differ greatly from the standard ichthyosaurian body plan, indicating much greater morphological diversity and range of feeding adaptations in ichthyosaurs than previously recognized. Phylogenetic analysis indicates a monophyletic clade consisting of the giant Shonisaurus sikanniensis, Guanlingsaurus liangae, and Shastasaurus pacificus to which the genus name Shastasaurus is applied. Shastasaurus liangae comb. nov. is from the Late Triassic (Carnian) Xiaowa Formation of Guizhou Province, southwestern China. The species combines a diminutive head with an entirely toothless and greatly reduced snout. The species also has by far the highest vertebral count among ichthyosaurs (86 presacral vertebrae and >110 caudal vertebrae), a count that is also very high for tetrapods in general. A reduced toothless snout and a diminutive head is also apparently present in the giant S. sikanniensis and presumably in S. pacificus. In analogy to many modern odontocetes, Shastasaurus is interpreted as a specialized suction feeder on unshelled cephalopods and fish, suggesting a unique but widespread Late Triassic diversification of toothless, suction-feeding ichthyosaurs. Suction feeding has not been hypothesized for any of the other diverse marine reptiles of the Mesozoic before, but in Shastasaurus may be linked to the Late Triassic minimum in atmospheric oxygen.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Patterns of variation in levels of homoplasy were explored through statistical analyses of standardized consistency indexes. Data were obtained from 60 recent cladistic analyses of a wide variety of organisms based on several different kinds of characters. Consistency index is highly correlated with the number of taxa included in an analysis, with homoplasy increasing as the number of taxa increases. This observation is compatible with a simple model of character evolution in which 1) the probability of character-state change increases with the total number of branches in a tree and 2) the number of possible states of a character is limited. Consistency index does not show a significant relationship to the number of characters utilized in an analysis or to the taxonomic rank of the terminal taxa. When the relationship between consistency index and number of taxa is taken into account, there is no significant difference between plant and animal data sets in the amount of homoplasy. Likewise, the level of homoplasy in morphological and molecular data sets does not appear to differ significantly, although there are still too few molecular studies to be confident of this result. Future comparisons of consistency indexes, including studies along the lines established here, must take into account the influence of the number of taxa on homoplasy.}},

A cladistic analysis of this matrix for only the extant taxa produced two equally parsimonious trees that call into question the monophyly of some of the previously accepted major higher-level tetraodontiform clades. Inclusion in the analysis of the large number of available fossil taxa helps to resolve relationships between family level clades.

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract. Triassic pistosauroids are closely related to the Plesiosauria which flourished later in the Mesozoic, but their fossil record has been poor due to the fragmentary nature of the known specimens. Yunguisaurus liae Cheng et al. (2006) (Reptilia, Sauropterygia) from China was the first Triassic pistosauroid represented by an almost complete skeleton, and we provide a full description of the holotype specimen based on the result of complete preparation of the skull and postcranium. A revised diagnosis characterizes Y. liae by a mixture of primitive and derived features for sauropterygians, such as the high number of cervical vertebrae (similar to the Plesiosauria) with large zygapophyses (shared with basal sauropterygians). The holotype skeleton likely represents a juvenile individual. In a revised phylogeny, relationships among the Triassic pistosauroids are fully resolved but weakly supported; the revised phylogeny differs from the existing hypothesis on a sauropterygian relationship, likely due to the previous reliance on fragmentary taxa. The long neck and hyperphalangy give an impression that Yunguisaurus is very ?plesiosaurian,? but detailed comparison revealed morphological differences in various parts of the postcranial. These differences, in combination with the revised phylogenetic hypothesis, suggest that Yunguisaurus was not necessarily comparable to the Plesiosauria in terms of body plan and mode of swimming.}},

Size and morphological differences between the two specimens are mostly regarded as ontogenetic variation, and newly added data did not affect the phylogenetic relationships with other pistosauroids significantly. The number of mesopodia (11 carpals and 8 tarsals) exceeds that known in any other Triassic marine reptiles and does not serve as a precursor of the plesiosaurian pattern with fewer mesopodia of different topology; it demonstrates variability of the limb morphology among the Triassic pistosauroids. The pectoral girdles of Corosaurus, Augustasaurus and Yunguisaurus may indicate early stages of the adaptation towards the plesiosaurian style of paraxial limb movements with ventroposterior power stroke.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Colepiocephale lambei from the Foremost Formation of Alberta is a problematic pachycephalosaurid that has recently been hypothesized as (1) synonymous with Stegoceras validum, (2) a distinct species within the Stegoceras clade, and (3) an unusual taxon more derived than Stegoceras. Conflict among these hypotheses arises from different interpretations of the parietosquamosal region of the dome. Re-evaluation of the morphology of C. lambei based on all known material from Alberta indicates that the posteromedial extension of the parietal is broken off at its base in every specimen, and what was interpreted as the posterior margin of the dome actually is the anterior margins of large supratemporal fenestrae. The squamosals are not preserved in any specimen, but the form of the parietal suggests that they were present in the typical pachycephalosaurid configuration. Colepiocephale lambei is considered to be a distinct taxon based on several autapomorphies and stratigraphic segregation from S. validum. Phylogenetic analyses that include new anatomical data confirm that C. lambei occupies a basal position within domed pachycephalosaurids, but its precise systematic position with respect to S. validum remains equivocal. This general interpretation is more consistent with its stratigraphic position as one of the oldest known members of Pachycephalosauridae. Additionally, this study results in the recognition of the first material referable to this taxon from the Judith River Formation of Montana, which results in a geographic range extension for this taxon and extends its stratigraphic range into the equivalent of the lower Oldman Formation in Alberta.}},

It is the sister taxon of Uranolophus, both being the most primitive dipnoans in a resolved cladogram of Devonian dipnoans. The first resolved cladogram of Devonian dipnoans shows that denticulation is the primitive feature of dipnoans, it reoccurs independently as a neotenic feature in the Late Devonian (Barwickia to Jarvikia) and also in Carboniferous/Permian (Conchopoma) dipnoans. True dipnoan tooth plates appear with Stomiahykus in the dipnoan phylogeny above Dipnorhynchus. ?Dipnorhynchus? lehmanni does not cluster with ?Speonesydrion? iani, which is part of the genus Dipnorhynchus.

  Abstract                 = {{Seven contrasting hypotheses of relationships of sarcopterygian groups are compared. The sister-group relationship of tetrapods to different fossil and Recent sarcopterygians is presented in the various hypotheses. Three possible sister-group relationships of tetrapods (to the Recent sarcopterygians, the Dipnoi, and Actinistia) are found among the seven hypotheses. The analyses presented here support all three possibilities to different degrees. Analysis of the complete data set drawn from studies that supported all seven hypotheses indicates that fossil taxa are more closely related to tetrapods than are Recent taxa. The Panderichthyida is the sister group of tetrapods, and both groups, together with Osteolepiformes, form the Choanata (the only osteichthyans with a true choana and one external nasal opening). The differences among the seven hypotheses are based on differences in selection of characters, as well as differences in hypotheses of homology. A test for congruence (synapomorphy) supports the initial homologizations. A careful analysis of each character for similarity and congruence is required before we may gain a higher level of reconciliation among the proposed hypotheses.}},

  Abstract                 = {{An almost complete skeleton with partial cranial material (ZMNH-M8739) is recovered from the Early or Middle Jurassic of southwest China. ZMNH-M8739 is identified as a juvenile individual of basal sauropodomorph dinosaur, Yunnanosaurus robustus Young, 1951. The revised diagnoses are as follows: absence of anteroposterior expansion on the medial end of astragalus and dorsoventrally compressed medium shaft of the metatarsal IV. Unfused neural arch and finely grooved long bone surface texture indicate that this individual is in the immature growth stage. ZMNH-M8739 possesses the tooth?tooth wear facet on its mesial maxillary and dentary teeth. However, the distal maxillary teeth have coarse serrations. Such a characteristic dentition could represent a unique feeding mechanism of this animal. Finally, ZMNH-M8739 constitutes a monophyletic group with Y. robustus (holotype), and Y. huangi is nesting this clade in the phylogenetic tree of the present analysis. Comparison of juvenile and adult specimen reveals distinctive growth changes of Y. robustus. This clade is positioned in an unnamed clade at a sister taxon of Sauropoda. Finally, some members of the so-called prosauropod dinosaurs constitute a monophyletic group in the present result.}},

A continuous morphological spectrum unites the basal members of Saurischia, Theropoda, Sauropodomorpha, Ornithischia, Thyreophora, Marginocephalia, and Ornithopoda with Nodosauridae and Pachycephalosauria and with the basal ornithodirans Silesaurus and Marasuchus.

One such way is to use creation science itself to demonstrate evolutionary principles. Some creation scientists use classic multidimensional scaling (CMDS) to quantify and visualize morphological gaps or continuity between taxa, accepting gaps as evidence of independent creation and accepting continuity as evidence of genetic relatedness. Here, I apply CMDS to a phylogenetic analysis of coelurosaurian dinosaurs and show that it reveals morphological continuity between Archaeopteryx, other early birds, and a wide range of nonavian coelurosaurs. Creation scientists who use CMDS must therefore accept that these animals are genetically related. Other uses of CMDS for evolutionary biologists include the identification of taxa with much missing evolutionary history and the tracing of the progressive filling of morphological gaps in the fossil record through successive years of discovery.}},

The analysis results in wide phylogenetic separation between Caenagnathus (close to the base of Oviraptorosauria) and Chirostenotes (placed within a clade of crested oviraptorids), casting doubt on their synonymy. All taxa with an enlarged, trenchant ungual on the second toe are placed within Troodontidae or Dromaeosauridae; at the base of the latter is an unenlagiine clade that includes Unenlagia and Rahonavis.

Herein we describe a theropod maxilla from the Lower Cretaceous Cedar Mountain Formation of Utah and perform a phylogenetic analysis to determine its phylogenetic position.

Phylogenetic analysis places G. suarezarum within Troodontidae in an unresolved polytomy with Mei, Byronosaurus, Sinornithoides, Sinusonasus, and Troodon + (Saurornithoides + Zanabazar). Geminiraptor suarezarum uniquely exhibits extreme pneumatic inflation of the maxilla internal to the antorbital fossa such that the anterior maxilla has a triangular cross-section. Unlike troodontids more closely related to Troodon, G. suarezarum exhibits bony septa between the dental alveoli and a promaxillary foramen that is visible in lateral view. This is the first report of a North American troodontid from the Lower Cretaceous. It therefore contributes to a fuller understanding of troodontid biogeography through time.

  Abstract                 = {{The Yellow Cat Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation (Early Cretaceous, Barremian? – Aptian) of Utah has yielded a rich theropod fauna, including the coelurosaur Nedcolbertia justinhofmanni, the therizinosauroid Falcarius utahensis, the troodontid Geminiraptor suarezarum, and the dromaeosaurid Utahraptor ostrommaysorum. Recent excavation has uncovered three new dromaeosaurid specimens. One specimen, which we designate the holotype of the new genus and species Yurgovuchia doellingi, is represented by a partial axial skeleton and a partial left pubis. A second specimen consists of a right pubis and a possibly associated radius. The third specimen consists of a tail skeleton that is unique among known Cedar Mountain dromaeosaurids. Y. doellingi resembles Utahraptor ostrommaysorum in that its caudal prezygapophyses are elongated but not to the degree present in most dromaeosaurids. The specimen represented by the right pubis exhibits a pronounced pubic tubercle, a velociraptorine trait that is absent in Y. doellingi. The specimen represented by the tail skeleton exhibits the extreme elongation of the caudal prezygapophyses that is typical of most dromaeosaurids. Here we perform a phylogenetic analysis to determine the phylogenetic position of Y. doellingi. Using the resulting phylogeny as a framework, we trace changes in character states of the tail across Coelurosauria to elucidate the evolution of the dromaeosaurid tail. The new specimens add to the known diversity of Dromaeosauridae and to the known diversity within the Yellow Cat paleofauna. Phylogenetic analysis places Y. doellingi in a clade with Utahraptor, Achillobator, and Dromaeosaurus. Character state distribution indicates that the presence of intermediate-length caudal prezygapophyses in that clade is not an evolutionarily precursor to extreme prezygapophyseal elongation but represents a secondary shortening of caudal prezygapophyses. It appears to represent part of a trend within Dromaeosauridae that couples an increase in tail flexibility with increasing size.}},

The dinosaurian radiation, launched by 1-meter-long bipeds, was slower in tempo and more restricted in adaptive scope than that of therian mammals. A notable exception was the evolution of birds from small-bodied predatory dinosaurs, which involved a dramatic decrease in body size. Recurring phylogenetic trends among dinosaurs include, to the contrary, increase in body size. There is no evidence for co-evolution between predators and prey or between herbivores and flowering plants. As the major land masses drifted apart, dinosaurian biogeography was molded more by regional extinction and intercontinental dispersal than by the breakup sequence of Pangaea.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT New specimens of Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis shed light on the structure and function of the pectoral girdle and forelimb in early theropod dinosaurs. As in tetanurian theropods, the scapulocoracoid has a broadly expanded acromion and strap-shaped scapular blade. The forelimb is less than one-half the length of the hind-limb and is specialized for prey capture and manipulation. The short proximal segments of the forelimb provide mechanical advantage and are marked by prominent tuberosities. The well-ossified carpus is divided into two functional units, one composed of the radiale and ulnare and the other composed of a centrale and distal carpals, and is designed functionally for dorsoventral extension and flexion of the manus against the forearm. The manus is longer than the humerus, radius, or ulna and is specialized for grasping and raking, as shown by the marked metacarpal extensor depressions, long penultimate phalanges, and trenchant unguals in digits I?III. Upon flexion or extension, the unguals of digits I?III converge. Manual digits IV and V are very reduced, and the phalangeal formula is 2?3?4?1?0. Increase in the length of the deltopectoral crest and decrease in the length of manual digit IV and loss of its terminal ungual constitute the only dinosaurian synapomorphies in the pectoral girdle and forelimb. Many previously cited dinosaurian synapomorphies in the pectoral girdle and forelimb cannot be substantiated. Several synapomorphies in the scapula and manus unite Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis with other theropods.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Archosaurs first appeared in the Middle Triassic and within a short interval of time came to dominate all faunas of large vertebrates for the remainder of the Mesozoic. It is widely held that shortly after archosaurs first appeared the group split into two clades, now termed ?Pseudosuchia? and ?Ornithosuchia.? Each clade independently evolved a rotary-style ankle design (?crocodile-normal? and ?crocodile-reversed,? respectively) and each independently evolved from semi-erect to erect limb posture. Erect posture, in turn, has been identified as the key adaptation (possibly associated with locomotor stamina) that resulted in the archosaurian radiation. These hypotheses are examined in light of a numerical cladistic analysis of basal archosaurs. Contrary to previous schemes, Archosauria is divided into Crurotarsi and Ornithodira. Crurotarsi (Suchia + Ornithosuchidae + Parasuchia) is characterized by the rotary crurotarsal ankle joint and other postcranial synapomorphies; this style of ankle joint thus appears to have evolved once rather than twice. Ornithodira is divided into Pterosauria and Dinosauromorpha. Pterosaurs, therefore, occupy a basal position within Ornithodira and do not constitute the sister-group to Dinosauria as has been suggested. The supposed pterosaur precursor, Scleromochlus, is reexamined and its proximity to Pterosauria is questioned. The analysis underscores the perils of employing functional constructs, such as ankle ?types,? rather than character data in phylogeny reconstruction. Current scenarios for the evolution of upright posture in archosaurs?either as an ?improvement? in design or as a correlate of locomotor stamina?are not supported by the cladistic pattern. Erect archosaurs coexisted for millions of years alongside more abundant sprawling or semi-erect rhynchosaurs and synapsids and radiated only after their demise. Osteological features associated with locomotor stamina in living tetrapods do not appear to be strongly correlated with erect posture among archosaurs. Once erect posture had been achieved in archosaurs, however, it may have promoted the evolution of bipedal locomotion, which appears at about the same time. Bipedal locomotion, in turn, may have permitted more extensive modification of the forelimbs, which in a short interval of time were fashioned as wing supports for powered flight in pterosaurs.}},

The remains, which represent a new genus and species, reveal the extreme elongation and transverse compression of the spinosaurid snout. The postcranial bones include blade-shaped vertebral spines that form a low sail over the hips. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the enlarged thumb claw and robust forelimb evolved during the Jurassic, before the elongated snout and other fish-eating adaptations in the skull. The close phylogenetic relationship between the new African spinosaurid andBaryonyx from Europe provides evidence of dispersal across the Tethys seaway during the Early Cretaceous.}},

  Abstract                 = {{We report the discovery of basal abelisaurid and carcharodontosaurid theropods from the mid Cretaceous (Aptian?Albian, ca. 112 Ma) Elrhaz Formation of the Niger Republic. The abelisaurid, Kryptops palaios gen. et sp. nov., is represented by a single individual preserving the maxilla, pelvic girdle, vertebrae and ribs. Several features, including a maxilla textured externally by impressed vascular grooves and a narrow antorbital fossa, clearly place Kryptops palaios within Abelisauridae as its oldest known member. The carcharodontosaurid, Eocarcharia dinops gen. et sp. nov., is represented by several cranial bones and isolated teeth. Phylogenetic analysis places it as a basal carcharodontosaurid, similar to Acrocanthosaurus and less derived than Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus. The discovery of these taxa suggests that large body size and many of the derived cranial features of abelisaurids and carcharodontosaurids had already evolved by the mid Cretaceous. The presence of a close relative of the North American genus Acrocanthosaurus on Africa suggests that carcharodontosaurids had already achieved a trans-Tethyan distribution by the mid Cretaceous.}},

Another, represented by a partial skeleton with slender proportions, is a new basal coelurosaur closely resembling the Egyptian genus Bahariasaurus. Comparisons with Cretaceous theropods from other continents reveal a previously unrecognized global radiation of carcharodontosaurid predators.

We dismember the holotype of P. triassicus on convincing evidence?theropod synapomorphies in the postcranium and crocodylomorph synapomorphies in the skull and referred material. We demonstrate, furthermore, that the holotype skull and a referred skull and partial forelimb belong to the contemporary basal crocodylomorph Saltoposuchus connectens. Saltoposuchus connectens, now with a nearly complete skull, carpus, and manus, is compared in detail to other basal crocodylomorphs. Current opinion maintains that S. connectens is the sister-group to all other crocodylomorphs and that other sphenosuchians constitute a paraphyletic assemblage of sister-taxa to Crocodyliformes. This view is overturned by a quantitative cladistic analysis of 20 characters, which suggests that by the Late Triassic crocodylomorphs had already split into two clades, Sphenosuchia and Crocodyliformes. Sphenosuchians evolved cursorial locomotor capabilities, with a digitigrade manus and particularly gracile long-bone proportions appearing in a subgroup including S. connectens. Crocodyliforms, in contrast, were more heavily armored, with stouter long-bones and a plantigrade manus and pes, and may not have evolved from cursorial predecessors as has generally been assumed.}},

The fossils include an immediate abelisauroid antecedent of Early Cretaceous age (ca. 130–110 Myr ago), early members of the two abelisauroid subgroups (Noasauridae, Abelisauridae) of Mid–Cretaceous age (ca. 110 Myr ago) and a hornless abelisaurid skull of early Late Cretaceous age (ca. 95 Myr ago). Together, these fossils fill in the early history of the abelisauroid radiation and provide key evidence for continued faunal exchange among Gondwanan landmasses until the end of the Early Cretaceous (ca. 100 Myr ago).}},

Its extreme adaptations for herbivory at ground-level challenge current hypotheses regarding feeding function and feeding strategy among diplodocoids, the larger clade of sauropods that includes Nigersaurus. We used high resolution computed tomography, stereolithography, and standard molding and casting techniques to reassemble the extremely fragile skull. Computed tomography also allowed us to render the first endocast for a sauropod preserving portions of the olfactory bulbs, cerebrum and inner ear, the latter permitting us to establish habitual head posture. To elucidate evidence of tooth wear and tooth replacement rate, we used photographic-casting techniques and crown thin sections, respectively. To reconstruct its 9-meter postcranial skeleton, we combined and size-adjusted multiple partial skeletons. Finally, we used maximum parsimony algorithms on character data to obtain the best estimate of phylogenetic relationships among diplodocoid sauropods. Nigersaurus taqueti shows extreme adaptations for a dinosaurian herbivore including a skull of extremely light construction, tooth batteries located at the distal end of the jaws, tooth replacement as fast as one per month, an expanded muzzle that faces directly toward the ground, and hollow presacral vertebral centra with more air sac space than bone by volume. A cranial endocast provides the first reasonably complete view of a sauropod brain including its small olfactory bulbs and cerebrum. Skeletal and dental evidence suggests that Nigersaurus was a ground-level herbivore that gathered and sliced relatively soft vegetation, the culmination of a low-browsing feeding strategy first established among diplodocoids during the Jurassic.}},

In contrast to amphioxus2, lampreys and other vertebrates possess a complex brain and placodes that contribute to well-developed eyes, as well as auditory and olfactory systems3. These sensory sytems were arguably a trigger to subsequent vertebrate diversifications. However, although they are known from skeletal impressions in younger Palaeozoic agnathans4, information about the earliest records of these systems has been largely wanting. Here we report numerous specimens of the Lower Cambrian vertebrate Haikouichthys ercaicunensis, until now only known from the holotype5. Haikouichthys shows significant differences from other fossil agnathans: key features include a small lobate extension to the head, with eyes and possible nasal sacs, as well as what may be otic capsules. A notochord with separate vertebral elements is also identifiable. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this fish lies within the stem-group craniates. Although Haikouichthys somewhat resembles the ammocoete larva of modern lampreys, this is because of shared general craniate characters; adult lampreys and hagfishes (the cyclostomes if monophyletic6, 7) are probably derived in many respects.}},

However, nodal support and results from exploratory implied weights analysis indicated that relationships among the five clades were effectively unresolved. Analysis of extant and fossil genera recovered a clade, Pantetrapulmonata nom nov., with the topology (Trigonotarbida (Araneae (Haptopoda (Pedipalpi)))). Arachnida was recovered as monophyletic with the internal relationships (Stomothecata (Palpigradi, Acaromorpha (Haplocnemata, Pantetrapulmonata))). Nodal support and exploratory implied weights indicated that relationships among these five clades were effectively unresolved. Thus, some interordinal relationships were strongly and/or consistently supported by morphology, but arachnid phylogeny is unresolved at its deepest levels. Alternative hypotheses proposed in the recent literature were evaluated by constraining analyses to recover hypothesized clades, an exercise that often resulted in the collapse of otherwise well-supported clades. These results suggest that attempts to resolve specific nodes based on individual characters, lists of similarities, evolutionary scenarios, etc., are problematic, as they ignore broader impacts on homoplasy and analytical effects on non-target nodes. {\copyright} 2007 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2007, 150, 221–265.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract The single bony element forming the lower jaw of living mammals, the dentary, has been interpreted as representing the culmination of a long and gradual evolutionary trend. Numerous fossil nonmammalian synapsids (?mammal-like reptiles?) show varying degrees of enlargement of the dentary and concomitant reduction in the postdentary bones. To quantitatively reexamine patterns of morphological change in the evolution of the mammalian lower jaw, measurement and discrete character data were collected from 322 fossil synapsid mandibles spanning Late Carboniferous through Jurassic time. Measurements confirm that the relative contribution of the dentary increased in theriodont (advanced therapsid) evolution with regard to both stratigraphic and phylogenetic position. However, dentary enlargement and postdentary reduction failed to typify all therapsid subclades. Qualitative characters of the mandible were used to quantify morphological similarity with regard to the early mammal Morganucodon. Analyses contrasting stratigraphic and phylogenetic position with mammalian similarity indicate that mandibular evolution was primarily conservative, with only anomodont therapsids evolving substantial morphological novelty. Scaling analyses comparing the area of the dentary and postdentary regions to jaw length uniformly show isometry or slight positive allometry, although cynodont therapsids have a smaller postdentary region than any other therapsid subgroup. These results suggest that body size decreases cannot fully explain the reduction of the postdentary bones. Finally, step size bias was tested as a mechanism for explaining long-term trends. Qualitative data reveal no significant difference in the magnitude of character changes occurring in mammalian and nonmammalian directions.}},

They first appear in the late Paleocene and are believed to have arisen from cassiduloid ancestry, but identifying sister-group relationships more precisely has proved difficult. Two factors are responsible for this problem, the extreme morphological conservatism of cassiduloids, which has given rise to high levels of character exhaustion, and the origin of crown-group clypeasteroids through paedomorphosis. Previous analyses, based on extant representatives alone or including all Mesozoic to Recent genera, have proved unsatisfactory. Here a parsimony analysis is undertaken using a restricted set of all stem-group clypeasteroids and cassiduloid taxa that existed immediately prior to the appearance of crown-group clypeasteroids. Inclusion of Togocyamus, the fossil taxon lying closest to the origin of crown-group clypeasteroids, is phylogenetically uninformative because that taxon is highly paedomorphic and has only generalized juvenile characteristics. However, earlier stem-group plesions provide critical data that identify Apatopygidae as extant sister group to the Clypeasteroida. Stratigraphically restricted analyses cannot eradicate the problems that arise from character exhaustion, but can minimize these with respect to specific phylogenetic questions.}},

It belongs to the species Krama devonica (Bassler) but is unusual in being a mirror image form. This is interpreted as the product of situs inversus during larval development whereby the coeloms on the right side rather than the left side of the bilateral larva have given rise to the definitive adult structures. Thus the hydropore lies in its mirror image position vis-\`{a}-vis the anterior/posterior axis and this axis must be homologous with Lov\'{e}n's symmetry plane in echinoids. The phylogenetic position of Krama is analysed cladistically and, by combining this with available stratigraphical information, the most parsimonious phylogenetic tree is produced for the subfamily Agelacrinitinae.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT A new avian species from the late early Eocene Fossil Butte Member of the Green River Formation is described based on a nearly complete postcranial skeleton. The new species, Vadaravis brownae, gen. et sp. nov., can be diagnosed by a unique combination of characters, including the following autapomorphies, which are unique among Aves: two (cranial and caudal) small and discrete pneumatopores on the lateral sides of the caudal-most thoracic centra; and a caudoventrally located pisiform process of the carpometacarpus that projects only weakly cranially. Phylogenetic analyses recover Vadaravis as a member of the waterbird assemblage (including, e.g., penguins, storks, pelicans), closely related to taxa traditionally placed within the avian order Ciconiiformes (storks, flamingos, herons, the hamerkop, ibises, and spoonbills). Additional morphological features and a phylogenetic analysis constrained by a recently recovered waterbird topology suggest close affinities between Vadaravis and Threskiornithidae. This new species represents the first proposed part of Ciconiiformes (and possibly stem-Threskiornithidae) in the Green River Formation of North America. Its discovery increases the known taxonomic and ecological diversity of this diverse fossil avifauna. Vadaravis also represents one of the oldest members of Ciconiiformes (and possibly stem-Threskiornithidae), and implies that additional lineages within the waterbird assemblage had diverged by the late early Eocene.

Here we describe an ulna from the Early Cretaceous Eumeralla Formation of Australia that shares unique autapomorphies with the South American theropod Megaraptor. We also present evidence for the spinosauroid affinities of Megaraptor. This ulna represents the first Australian non-avian theropod with unquestionable affinities to taxa from other Gondwanan landmasses, suggesting faunal interchange between eastern and western Gondwana during the Mid-Cretaceous. This evidence counters claims of Laurasian affinities for Early Cretaceous Australian dinosaur faunas, and for the existence of a geographical or climatic barrier isolating Australia from the other Gondwanan continents during this time. The temporal and geographical distribution of Megaraptor and the Eumeralla ulna is also inconsistent with traditional palaeogeographic models for the fragmentation of Gondwana, but compatible with several alternative models positing connections between South America and Antarctica in the Mid-Cretaceous.}},

An in-depth morphological description of Cryolophosaurus is presented here, along with a rigorous phylogenetic analysis of theropod relationships consisting of 347 characters and 56 taxa, in an attempt to clarify the relationships of Cryolophosaurus and to provide insight into questions surrounding early theropod evolution. Cryolophosaurus is characterized by a unique cranial crest, formed primarily by the lacrimals, a pronounced constriction of the squamosal and jugal bones across the infratemporal fenestra, and extremely elongate cranial processes on the cervical ribs. Several shared characters, including the presence of a slot-shaped foramen at the base of the nasal process of the premaxilla, nasolacrimal crests and erect tab-like dorsal processes on the articular, suggest affinities between Cryolophosaurus and a clade of medium-bodied Early Jurassic theropods that includes 'Dilophosaurus'sinensis, Dracovenator regenti and Dilophosaurus wetherilli. This clade is recovered as sister-taxon to a Neoceratosauria + Tetanurae clade, rendering both a traditional Coelophysoidea and Ceratosauria non-monophyletic. Cryolophosaurus represents the largest known Early Jurassic theropod, and marks the beginning of theropod occupation of the dominant predator niche in the Mesozoic. {\copyright} 2007 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2007, 151, 377–421.}},

Here we describe a new taxon from the Upper Permian Teekloof Formation of South Africa that is remarkably similar to Proburnetia. Paraburnetia sneeubergensis, gen. and sp. nov., is diagnosed by the following autapomorphies: supratemporal ?horn? oriented vertically with bulbous terminal end, supra-orbital boss with well-defined apical crest, and palatine-pterygoid boss elongate. Paraburnetia and Proburnetia share features indicating a sister-taxon relationship, including the presence of a well-developed median nasal crest and tall supraorbital bosses. Along with the close morphological similarity and phylogenetic relationships of several dicynodont taxa from Russia and South Africa, the discovery of Paraburnetia indicates that long-distance, north-south interchange was commonplace during the Late Permian and that burnetiamorphs likely had a Pangean distribution.}},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract It is generally accepted that male genitalia evolve more rapidly and divergently relative to non-genital traits due to sexual selection, but there is little quantitative comparison of the pattern of evolution between these character sets. Moreover, despite the fact that genitalia are still among the most widely used characters in insect systematics, there is an idea that the rate of evolution is too rapid for genital characters to be useful in forming clades. Based on standard measures of fit used in cladistic analyses, we compare levels of homoplasy and synapomorphy between genital and non-genital characters of published data sets and demonstrate that phylogenetic signal between these two character sets is statistically similar. This pattern is found consistently across different insect orders at different taxonomic hierarchical levels. We argue that the fact that male genitalia are under sexual selection and thus diverge rapidly does not necessarily equate with the lack of phylogenetic signal, because characters that evolve by descent with modification make appropriate characters for a phylogenetic analysis, regardless of the rate of evolution. We conclude that male genitalia are a composite character consisting of different components diverging separately, which make them ideal characters for phylogenetic analyses, providing information for resolving varying levels of hierarchy. {\\\\\\\\copyright} The Willi Hennig Society 2009.},

  Abstract                 = {{Previous analyses of the mammalian clade Carnivoramorpha have tended to sample only cranial and dental character systems, particularly those that included early Cenozoic taxa, Viverravidae and basal Carnivoraformes (the latter being a paraphyletic array of taxa traditionally referred to as the ?Miacidae?). In this study we add more than 100 postcranial characters to an existing dataset dominated by cranio-dental characters. The addition of the new characters permits the inclusion of a large number of basal carnivoraforms, known solely or predominantly from postcranial characters, that previously would have been ?unplaceable? in a phylogenetic analysis. The resultant phylogeny recovers most of the same clades identified in previous studies, but resolves some relationships differently within the basal carnivoraforms. A novel (unnamed) monophyletic subclade of the Carnivoraformes is recovered, supported in part by characters from both the prior and new datasets. The inclusion of a substantial suite of postcranial characters expands the ability to assess the relationships of basal carnivoramorphan taxa, and permits the inclusion of many taxa represented only by incomplete material.}},

A phylogenetic analysis showed that the genus Watsonisuchus is justified, although its species W. madagascariensis is not the most derived within the genus. The skull growth of W. madagascariensis clearly shows an allometric trend, but the fact that adults have more dermo-sensory grooves than juveniles suggests surprisingly that they may have become progressively more aquatic during growth. The ontogeny of W. madagascariensis is compared with that of other temnospondyls. Different longi-rostrine conditions are observed in Permian and Triassic stereospondylomorphs (archegosaurians and capitosaurians, respectively). They are interpreted as convergences rather than are a synapomorphy of the clade.}},

Several Early Devonian schizo?phoriid species are placed within S. (Eoschuchertella), while all other North American Devonian and Mississippian species studied are placed within S. (Schizophoria). Schizophoria meeki Fenton \& Fenton is synonymised with S. macfarlanii Meek. Ancestral forms of Schizophoria (Schizophoria) were present in Europe and the Appalachian basin and inhabited outer platform environments through the Frasnian. Several independent lineages of S. (Schizophoria) persisted through the Late Devonian biodiversity crisis and subsequently colonised nearshore environments. Most cladogenetic events within North American species of S. (Schizophoria) occurred via dispersal mechanisms, while vicariant speciation was rare. Cladistic analysis of North American species assigned to ?Schuchertella? revealed that all species through the Frasnian belong to Floweria, an impunctate genus, while Famennian and later species belong to Schuchertella. The generic placement of the Devonian ?schuchertellids? is revised accordingly. Schuchertella and Floweria are superficially similar and exhibit an analagous (albeit temporally offset) evolutionary transition from free?resting ancestors to descendants with attached pedicle valves. Floweria also exhibits reduced rates of vicariant speciation compared to speciation by dispersal. The relative reduction in vicariant speciation has been documented for other Devonian taxa (bivalves, phyllocarids and trilobites) and may be an important control on faunal dynamics in North America during the Late Devonian biodiversity crisis.}},

Here, I present complete morphological descriptions of the skull material of a new taxon from the Sonsela Member (Chinle Formation) of Petrified Forest National Park, Arizona, with the first rigorous phylogenetic analysis focused on the interrelationships of Leptosuchus. The new taxon is recovered as the sister taxon to Pseudopalatinae. It possesses one unambiguous synapomorphy (the 'septomaxillae' form part of the lateral borders of the nares) and shares the presence of a subsidiary opisthotic process with Pseudopalatinae. The new taxon does not fall within the restricted clade Leptosuchus. In my analysis, the previously proposed, but undemonstrated, sister taxon relationship between Angistorhinus and Rutiodon is not supported, Paleorhinus is recovered as paraphyletic, and a subset of taxa traditionally included within Leptosuchus are found to be more closely related to Pseudopalatinae, rendering Leptosuchus paraphyletic. 'Leptosuchus'adamanensis emerges as sister taxon to Smilosuchus gregorii and is here referred to as Smilosuchus adamanensis nov. comb., and 'Machaeroprosopus'lithodendrorum is also transferred to Smilosuchus lithodendrorum nov. comb. Documentation of the variation present within Phytosauria, and specifically within Leptosuchus sensu lato, demonstrates higher diversity within Phytosauria than previously appreciated and places the character states previously proposed for Pseudopalatinae into a broader context of shared characters.}},

The holotype comes from the Upper Triassic Wolfville Formation (Newark Supergroup) of Nova Scotia. The temporal region of the skull is of the euryapsid type. The premaxillary rostrum and dentary symphysis are elongate and edentulous. The dentition comprises distinctive, occluding upper and lower teeth. A phylogenetic analysis shows that Teraterpeton hrynewichorum is an archosauromorph reptile. Trilophosaurus buettneri from the Upper Triassic Dockum Group of Texas may represent a closely related species.}},

Close structural correspondence between the maxilla of this specimen and the mandible of Caenagnathus collinsi R. M.

The family-level taxon Elmisauridae Osm\'{o}lska, 1981 is regarded as a subjective junior synonym of Caenagnathidae R. M. Sternberg, 1940. The newly recognized specimen of Chirostenotes pergracilis provides important new evidence for referring Caenagnathidae to Oviraptorosauria.

However, the evolutionary diversification of this group after its initial radiation but prior to the Triassic–Jurassic boundary is still poorly understood because of a sparse fossil record near that boundary. Here, we report on a new basal theropod, Daemonosaurus chauliodus gen. et sp. nov., from the latest Triassic 'siltstone member' of the Chinle Formation of the Coelophysis Quarry at Ghost Ranch, New Mexico. Based on a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, Daemonosaurus is more closely related to coeval neotheropods (e.g. Coelophysis bauri) than to Herrerasauridae and Eoraptor. The skeletal structure of Daemonosaurus and the recently discovered Tawa bridge a morphological gap between Eoraptor and Herrerasauridae on one hand and neotheropods on the other, providing additional support for the theropod affinities of both Eoraptor and Herrerasauridae and demonstrating that lineages from the initial radiation of Dinosauria persisted until the end of the Triassic. Various features of the skull of Daemonosaurus, including the procumbent dentary and premaxillary teeth and greatly enlarged premaxillary and anterior maxillary teeth, clearly set this taxon apart from coeval neotheropods and demonstrate unexpected disparity in cranial shape among theropod dinosaurs just prior to the end of the Triassic.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Stegoceras (sensu lato) has been the recipient of a number of species. Most have been placed into synonymy with S. validum, some have been transferred to other genera (i.e., Gravitholus, Ornatotholus), whereas others have been interpreted as being sexual dimorphs. A parsimonious phylogenetic analysis using 49 characters, which include 9 new cranial characters based on pachycephalosaur frontoparietal domes, now permits a revision of the genus Stegoceras. This analysis concludes that Stegoceras validum (sensu stricto) is a primitive, incipiently-domed pachycephalosaur that is characterized by a well-developed squamosal shelf and open supratemporal fossae. It is the sister taxon to the fully-domed Pachycephalosaurinae. The taxon Ornatotholus browni has a parietal and displays features identical to S. validum and is therefore a subjective junior synonym. Specimens consisting of flat, paired frontals are immature individuals of S. validum. The holotype of ?Stegoceras? lambei, and all morphotypes of this species, are unique in the construction of the posterior squamosal region and are placed in a new genus, Colepiocephale. Colepiocephale lambei is known solely from the Foremost Formation and is the oldest diagnostic pachycephalosaur from North America. An incomplete, and indeterminate, skull from the upper part of the Milk River Formation (upper Santonian) has the distinction of being the oldest known North American pachycephalosaur. ?S.? sternbergi lacks a posterior squamosal shelf and has squamosals directed laterally and is placed in a new genus, Hanssuesia, as H. sternbergi. Although the taxon Gravitholus albertae displays some characters (i.e., retention of the posterior squamosals separated by a distinct median parietal) and is similar to H. sternbergi in some respects, the holotype is too incomplete for any definitive diagnosis and thus it is considered a nomen dubium. Sphaerotholus is a subjective junior of Prenocephale and the species Sphaerotholus buchholtzae is a subjective junior synonym of Prenocephale edmontonensis. The taxa Prenocephale brevis, P. edmontonensis, and P. goodwini, form a monophyletic clade with monotypic Asian taxa Prenocephale prenes and Tylocephale gilmorei as an unresolved sister group. They are united by the possession of a distinct row of nodes on the squamosal and parietale. Tylocephale, if valid, is interpreted as the sister taxon to the Prenocephale clade. Stenotholus kohleri is formally recognized as a junior synonym of Stygimoloch spinifer. Based on the presence of hypertrophied nodes Stygimoloch spinifier and Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis are united in the clade Pachycephalosaurini new taxon. Small-to-medium size Late Cretaceous pachycephalosaurs were rather diverse, especially during the late Campanian (ludithian), and many species coexisted during Campanian and Maastrictian times. Ancestry and directionality of dispersal (in part) of the North American and Asian taxa remains uncertain and certainly antedates Campanian time.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract Cambrian ptychopariids have defied most attempts at higher classification. Even at the generic level, there is no consensus as to what constitutes identification criteria in these morphologically conservative trilobites. The problem is more acute when there is a lack of knowledge about the different sclerites of species, the presence of species with morphologies intermediate between two genera, the naming of genera where incompletely known or poor quality specimens were used for type species, and the use of character checklists to generate diagnoses for higher taxa. This study on the kochaspid trilobites (Lower to Middle Cambrian) uses several available representatives of each genus to alleviate or assess some of these problems. Successive reweighting of characters is used for the assessment of 70 characters among 66 taxa as to their importance in forming clades. Results of this study include five important points about ptychopariid classification: 1) knowledge about noncranidial sclerites is important for the proper placement of taxa that have generalized morphologies; 2) in contrast, taxa that have more derived cranidial morphology can be accurately placed within a clade; 3) intermediate morphologies illustrate a close link between genera, but these forms can present nomenclatural problems in their placement; 4) although genera defined by type species based on incompletely described or poorly preserved specimens can create nomenclatural nightmares, other species assigned to these genera are not dependent on their previous taxonomic assignment for their placement in the cladogram; and 5) checklists of morphological characters cannot be used to recognize ptychopariid groups, since the level of homoplasy is too high and there are too many reversals of character states within a clade. Instead, a list of character states that typify a taxonomic group is more useful and will lead to a more stable classification. This cladistic analysis of kochaspid trilobites indicates that 64 of the 70 characters were useful in the formation of clades. Fifty-six cranidial, librigenal, thoracic, and pygidial characters were useful in typifying larger and smaller clades. The analysis also indicates that Eokochaspis, Nyella, and Onchocephalus are polyphyletic. Reassignments based on the cladistic analysis include Schistometopus collaris to Caborcella, and Syspacephalus obscurus to Mexicella.}},

New collections from the Ehmaniella Biozone contain cranidia, librigenae, hypostomes, rostral plates, thoracic segments, and pygidia, which allow a more complete understanding of the morphological range and character of this important species. Cladistic analyses using this new information about A. subcoronatum suggest that: 1) Ehmaniellidae Sundberg, 1994, is synonymous with Alokistocaridae; 2) Alokistocaridae is a monophylectic clade and not synonymous with Papyriaspididae Whitehouse, 1939; 3) Pseudoalokistocare Sundberg, 1994, is synonymous with Alokistocare; and 4) Taxa previously assigned to the older "Alokistocare"/Amecephalus group (Plagiura to Glossopleura biochrons) form a separate clade and should not be included in Alokistocare or the Alokistocaridae. These older species are assigned to Amecephalus Walcott, 1924, which is restricted to the Delamaran Stage. Alokistocaridae as recognized here is restricted to the Marjuman Stage. A morphometric analysis of Alokistocare subcoronatum shows minor but significant differences among collections, indicating population differences. In addition, the cranidium displays both positive and negative allometric growth as well as isometric growth. Allometric growth is present in both meraspid and holaspid stages. The pygidium shows only isometric growth.}},

Despite the group's apparent success since the Jurassic and impressive peak diversity in the mid-Cretaceous, most included clades are now severely reduced. A phylogeny is essential for reconstructing the taxonomic, environmental and biogeographic patterns of this decline, and understanding the causal processes responsible for them. I examined the distribution of qualitative morphological characters (including those defining genera) for 97 species from 77 non-clypeasteroid genera and the three clypeasteroid suborders. Following preliminary analyses, I reduced the data to 40 characters (having 60 apomorphic states) and 71 representative genera. Goloboff's data decisiveness, the skewness of tree length distributions, and permutation tests all reveal significant phylogenetic structure in the data. Heuristic searches conducted with PAUP found more than 72 500 trees of 217 steps (CI = 0.276), but only the first 30,000 were evaluated. These exhibit considerable instability in the relationships among taxa. Successive approximations weightings did not reduce the numbers of favoured trees. Analyses using only less homoplasious characters failed to improve the resolution. Fisher's stratigraphic debt provides an objective means of selecting a very few of the morphologically most-parsimonious trees. Most nodes are supported by only one to three character changes, and these are generally reversed or paralleled elsewhere. The results suggest some cassiduloid families can not be separated, and support the reassignment of several genera. Despite the high levels of homoplasy, the most-parsimonious trees require fewer changes than had been previously suggested for evolutionary trends in several characters. Whether the rampant homoplasy present in the data reflects incorrect character analysis, limited structural or developmental options, or the effects of parallel selection, its presence raises severe obstacles to phylogenetic analyses.}},

The unfused neurocentral sutures of all vertebrae suggest that the type specimen of Nipponosaurus is subadult. Furthermore, it can be diagnosed by the following characters: (1) the coronoid process of the surangular is robust, (2) the neural spine of the axis is only slightly developed, and (3) the lateral margin of the first phalanx on digit IV is strongly deflected. The phylogenetic analysis, using 78 characters for seven ingroup and six outgroup taxa, indicates that Nipponosaurus belongs within Lambeosaurinae as the sister taxon to Hypacrosaurus altispinus.}},

Discoveries of new Devonian and Carboniferous taxa have not only contributed to our knowledge of these animals, but have also complicated our understanding of their interrelationships. Over the preceding 50 years, there have been several new discoveries and redescriptions of early actinopterygians; however, Tegeolepis clarki, Kentuckia hlavini, and Stegotrachelus finlayi have never been fully redescribed. Although previous authors have re-examined the skull of S. finlayi, new material has recently been collected, in 1973 and 2002. This study synthesizes information from original and new material to fully redescribe S. finlayi, and incorporates these data into a cladistic analysis that examines the interrelationships of early actinopterygians. Phylogenetic systematic data returned support for a monophyletic Stegotrachelidae 2013 an evolutionary systematic hypothesis generated over 40 years ago. Previous palaeoenvironmental and biogeographic hypotheses were tested, with results supporting the independent freshwater origins of several Devonian actinopts, although a regional endemic grade of Gondwanan taxa is not confirmed. {\\\\\\\\copyright} 2009 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2009.},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Although the macronarian sauropod Brachiosaurus is one of the most iconic dinosaurs, its popular image is based almost entirely on the referred African species Brachiosaurus brancai rather than the North American type species Brachiosaurus altithorax. Reconsideration of Janensch's referral of the African species to the American genus shows that it was based on only four synapomorphies and would not be considered a convincing argument today. Detailed study of the bones of both species show that they are distinguished by at least 26 characters of the dorsal and caudal vertebrae, coracoids, humeri, ilia, and femora, with the dorsal vertebrae being particularly different between the two species. These animals must therefore be considered generically separate, and the genus name Giraffatitan Paul 1988 must be used for ” Brachiosaurus” brancai, in the combination Giraffatitan brancai. A phylogenetic analysis treating the two species as separate OTUs nevertheless recovers them as sister taxa in all most parsimonious trees, reaffirming a monophyletic Brachiosauridae, although only one additional step is required for Giraffatitan to clade among somphospondylians to the exclusion of Brachiosaurus. The American Brachiosaurus is shown to be somewhat different from Giraffatitan in overall bodily proportions: it had a longer and deeper trunk and probably a longer and taller tail, carried a greater proportion of its mass on the forelimbs, and may have had somewhat sprawled forelimbs. Even though it was overall a larger animal than the Giraffatitan lectotype, the Brachiosaurus holotype was probably immature, as its coracoids were not fused to its scapulae.}},

  Abstract                 = {{:\&\#8194; Xenoposeidon proneneukos gen. et sp. nov. is a neosauropod represented by BMNH R2095, a well-preserved partial mid-to-posterior dorsal vertebra from the Berriasian-Valanginian Hastings Beds Group of Ecclesbourne Glen, East Sussex, England. It was briefly described by Lydekker in 1893, but it has subsequently been overlooked. This specimen's concave cotyle, large lateral pneumatic fossae, complex system of bony laminae and camerate internal structure show that it represents a neosauropod dinosaur. However, it differs from all other sauropods in the form of its neural arch, which is taller than the centrum, covers the entire dorsal surface of the centrum, has its posterior margin continuous with that of the cotyle, and slopes forward at 35 degrees relative to the vertical. Also unique is a broad, flat area of featureless bone on the lateral face of the arch; the accessory infraparapophyseal and postzygapophyseal laminae which meet in a V; and the asymmetric neural canal, small and round posteriorly but large and teardrop-shaped anteriorly, bounded by arched supporting laminae. The specimen cannot be referred to any known sauropod genus, and clearly represents a new genus and possibly a new `family'. Other sauropod remains from the Hastings Beds Group represent basal Titanosauriformes, Titanosauria and Diplodocidae; X.\&\#8201;proneneukos may bring to four the number of sauropod `families' represented in this unit. Sauropods may in general have been much less morphologically conservative than is usually assumed. Since neurocentral fusion is complete in R2095, it is probably from a mature or nearly mature animal. Nevertheless, size comparisons of R2095 with corresponding vertebrae in the Brachiosaurus brancai holotype HMN SII and Diplodocus carnegii holotype CM 84 suggest a rather small sauropod: perhaps 15\&\#8201;m long and 7600\&\#8201;kg in mass if built like a brachiosaurid, or 20\&\#8201;m and 2800\&\#8201;kg if built like a diplodocid.}},

It is known from at least two fragmentary specimens of different sizes. The type specimen is OMNH 66430, the left ilium of a juvenile individual; tentatively referred specimens include a crushed presacral centrum, a complete and well-preserved mid-to-posterior caudal vertebra, the partial centrum of a distal caudal vertebra, a complete pneumatic anterior dorsal rib from the right side, the nearly complete left scapula of a much larger, presumably adult, individual, and two partial sternal plates. Brontomerus is diagnosed by five autapomorphies of the type specimen: preacetabular lobe 55\% of total ilium length, longer than in any other sauropod; preacetabular lobe directed anterolaterally at 30° to the sagittal, but straight in dorsal view and vertically oriented; postacetabular lobe reduced to near absence; ischiadic peduncle reduced to very low bulge; ilium proportionally taller than in any other sauropod, 52\% as high as long. In a phylogenetic analysis, Brontomerus was recovered as a camarasauromorph in all most parsimonious trees, but with uncertain position within that clade. The large preacetabular lobe of the ilium anchored powerful protractor and abductor muscles, but precise interpretation is impossible without functionally related elements such as femora and proximal caudal vertebrae. Brontomerus is the eighth sauropod genus named from the Early Cretaceous of North America, and more remain to be described: North American sauropod diversity did not decline catastrophically at the end of the Jurassic as often assumed. The most striking differences between Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous sauropod faunas in North America is that the former are abundant and dominated by diplodocids, whereas the latter are comparatively scarce? though still diverse?and dominated by macronarians.}},

Six fundamental ultrastructural fabrics are recognized which differ in the crystallographic orientations, shapes and prevailing growth directions of the constituent crystallites. During the growth of individual walls a succession of fabrics is secreted, defining a fabric suite. Five fabric suites are described in interior walls and four in exterior walls. Nine ultrastructural characters were combined with 37 other skeletal characters in a PAUP analysis of the relationships between 28 post-Palaeozoic cyclostomes chosen to include representatives of all suborders. A single tree of length 142 steps was found. Comparison of tree statistics for three categories of characters showed ultrastructural characters to be more homoplastic than zooidal characters, and the latter more homoplastic than colonial characters. Rooting the tree on the paleotubuliporine Cuffeyella gave four transitions from fixed- to free-walled organization and no reversals. With respect to the five extant suborders of cyclostomes, this first, preliminary analysis implies that Rectangulata and Cancellata are monophyletic groups, whereas Articulata are diphyletic, and both Tubuliporina and Cerioporina paraphyletic.}},

Eocene fossils document much of cetaceans' land-to-water transition, but, until now, the most primitive representative for which a skeleton was known was clearly amphibious and lived in coastal environments. Here we report on the skeletons of two early Eocene pakicetid cetaceans, the fox-sized Ichthyolestes pinfoldi, and the wolf-sized Pakicetus attocki. Their skeletons also elucidate the relationships of cetaceans to other mammals. Morphological cladistic analyses have shown cetaceans to be most closely related to one or more mesonychians, a group of extinct, archaic ungulates, but molecular analyses have indicated that they are the sister group to hippopotamids. Our cladistic analysis indicates that cetaceans are more closely related to artiodactyls than to any mesonychian. Cetaceans are not the sister group to (any) mesonychians, nor to hippopotamids. Our analysis stops short of identifying any particular artiodactyl family as the cetacean sister group and supports monophyly of artiodactyls.}},

Here, we present the most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the group attempted to date. The traditional ankylosaurid?nodosaurid dichotomy is maintained. Ankylosauridae forms a well-resolved clade, which includes Zhongyuansaurus, the first ankylosaurid known to lack a tail club. Nodosauridae includes a number of taxa that were resolved either as ?polacanthids? or basal ankylosaurids in previous analyses. The use of a broader character sample allows analysis of the interrelationships of all valid ankylosaur species; this has revealed several previously unrecognized relationships. Stegosauria is recovered as the sister taxon to Ankylosauria, while Scelidosaurus is found to be a basal thyreophoran. Dedicated methods for coding continuous characters could be used in future to improve the resolution of ankylosaur phylogeny, particularly in order to explore the relationships within the poorly resolved nodosaurid clade.}},

Ichthyosaurs passed through an evolutionary bottleneck at, or close to, the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, which reduced their diversity to as few as three or four lineages. Diversity bounced back to some extent in the aftermath of the end-Triassic mass extinction, but disparity remained at less than one-tenth of pre-extinction levels, and never recovered. The group remained at low diversity and disparity for its final 100 Myr. The end-Triassic mass extinction had a previously unsuspected profound effect in resetting the evolution of apex marine predators of the Mesozoic.}},

Crocodylomorpha, including living crocodilians and their extinct relatives, is the only group of pseudosuchians that survived into the Jurassic. We reassess changes in pseudosuchian morphological diversity (disparity) across this time interval, using considerably larger sample sizes than in previous analyses. Our results show that metrics of pseudosuchian disparity did not change significantly across the TJ boundary, contrasting with previous work suggesting low pseudosuchian disparity in the Early Jurassic following the TJ mass extinction. However, a significant shift in morphospace occupation between Late Triassic and Early Jurassic taxa is recognized, suggesting that the TJ extinction of many pseudosuchian lineages was followed by a major and geologically rapid adaptive radiation of crocodylomorphs. This marks the onset of the spectacularly successful evolutionary history of crocodylomorphs in Jurassic and Cretaceous ecosystems.}},

It preserves four caudal vertebrae, right and left humeri, and right and left femora. Other recovered bones are tentatively identified as left radius, right tibia, right fibula, and left ischium because of their fragmental preservation. This dinosaur is identified as a member of Titanosauria because it represents synapomorphies of the clade: (1) femoral fourth trochanter located on the caudomedial margin of the shaft, (2) approximately 0.89 of the humerus/femur length ratio, (3) presence of prominent "bulge" on the proximal lateral surface of the femur, (4) neural arch of middle caudal vertebra situated on the cranial half of the centrum, and (5) extreme eccentricity of the femur cross section (= 2.3). The combination of other characters may suggest that this dinosaur is a new taxon. The discovery of a possibly new titanosaurian dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous of Japan indicates that titanosaurians were more diverse in Asia, and their evolution was more complicated than previously thought.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Here, we present information regarding the braincase anatomy of Chanaresuchus ischigualastensis, from the Ischigualasto Formation (Carnian) of Argentina. The braincase is very similar to that previously described for Chanaresuchus bonapartei, but bears some differences: rostral contour of the basal tubera nearly transversely oriented in ventral view; basal tubera with rounded distal tips in ventral view; paroccipital processes with a slight distal widening in caudal view; sulcus on the caudal surface of each paroccipital process restricted to the proximal two-thirds of the latter; and parabasisphenoidal ventral surface transversely concave. A phylogenetic analysis was performed using exclusively neurocranial characters, including a few new characters, to investigate phylogenetic hypotheses suggested by the neurocranial evidence. The neurocranial data support a sister-group relationship between Chanaresuchus ischigualastensis and C. bonapartei, on the basis of the presence of an intertuberal plate with a concave border. Our analysis also suggests the monophyly of a group formed by both species of Chanaresuchus and Proterochampsa. This group was supported by one apomorphy: the paroccipital processes are elongated relative to their height, which did not show homoplasy in our results. Our results show that Doswellia is the sister group of the clade formed by these proterochampsids, supporting inclusion of the former within the Proterochampsia, and this clade is recovered as more closely related to archosaurs than to Euparkeria.}},

A phylogenetic analysis places it inside Diplodocinae (Sauropoda: Flagellicaudata: Diplodocidae), as a sister taxon to a clade uniting Tornieria africana and the classical diplodocines Barosaurus lentus and Diplodocus. The taxon is diagnosed by a unique combination of plesiomorphic and derived traits, as well as the following unambiguous autapomorphies within Diplodocidae: frontals separated anteriorly by a U-shaped notch; squamosals restricted to the post-orbital region; presence of a postparietal foramen; a narrow, sharp and distinct sagittal nuchal crest; the paired basal tuber with a straight anterior edge in ventral view; anterior end of the prezygapophyses of mid- and posterior cervical vertebrae is often an anterior extension of the pre-epipophysis, which projects considerably anterior to the articular facet; anterodorsal corner of the lateral side of the posterior cervical vertebrae marked by a rugose tuberosity; posterior margin of the prezygapophyseal articular facet of posterior cervical vertebrae bordered posteriorly by conspicuous transverse sulcus; posterior cervical neural spines parallel to converging. The inclusion of K. siberi and several newly described characters into a previously published phylogenetic analysis recovers the new taxon as basal diplodocine, which concurs well with the low stratigraphical position of the holotype specimen. Dinheirosaurus and Supersaurus now represent the sister clade to Apatosaurus and Diplodocinae and therefore the most basal diplodocid genera. The geographical location in the less known northern parts of the Morrison Fm., where K. siberi was found, corroborates previous hypotheses on faunal provinces within the formation. The probable subadult ontogenetic stage of the holotype specimen allows analysis of ontogenetic changes and their influence on diplodocid phylogeny.}},

With a total length of 290 mm, the present specimen represents one of the smallest skulls known for this species. Not surprisingly, it shows various characteristics common to juvenile tyrannosaurids, such as the rostral margin of the maxillary fenestra not reaching that of the external antorbital fenestra and the postorbital lacking the cornual process. The nasal bears a small lacrimal process, which disappears in adults. Lacking some of the morphological characteristics that are adapted for bearing great feeding forces in adult individuals, this juvenile specimen suggests that T. bataar would have changed its dietary niches during ontogeny. The numbers of alveoli in the maxilla (13) and dentary (14 and 15) are the same as those in adults, suggesting that they do not change ontogenetically in T. bataar and thus are not consistent with the hypothesis that the numbers of alveoli decreases ontogenetically in tyrannosaurids.}},

The holotype lacked cranial remains but the new material includes an almost complete skull as well as at least two additional partial skulls. These new specimens add important information and allow us to diagnose Mahajangasuchus insignis as a derived mesoeucrocodylian crocodyliform distinguished by the following combination of characters (autapomorphies indicated with an asterisk): broad platyrostral snout; laterally compressed and serrated teeth; dorsally arched mandible; prominent caudofemoralis flange on femur; surangular with prominent lateral expansion anterior to glenoid fossa; supraocciptial excludes the parietal from occipital margin; massive choanal septum*; anterior margins of choanal septum contact ventral lamina of pterygoid, enclosing internal choanae*; strongly arched jugal with depression below orbit*; three prominent ridges running longitudinally on dorsal surface of snout*; fused nasals.* The new specimen offers new information to explore the phylogenetic relationships of Mahajangasuchus insignis and bears important information for understanding the evolutionary history of the crocodyliform palate and the adaptive significance of the modern eusuchian-style palate. The phylogenetic analysis conducted results in the discovery of monophyly of the traditional Peirosauridae and a derived position for Mahajangasuchus and Stolokrosuchus as successive sister taxa to Neosuchia. Inclusion or exclusion of Trematochampsa taqueti, a fragmentary taxon from Africa, greatly affects the phylogenetic relations of Mahajangasuchus.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract Coelurosauria is the most diverse clade of theropod dinosaurs. Much of this diversity is present in Paraves?the clade of dinosaurs containing dromaeosaurids, troodontids, and avialans. Paraves has over 160 million years of evolutionary history that continues to the present day. The clade represents the most diverse living tetrapod group (there are over 9000 extant species of Aves?a word used here as synonomous with ?bird?), and it is at the root of the paravian radiation, when dromaeosaurids, troodontids, and avialans were diverging from one another, that we find the morphology and soft tissue changes associated with the origin of modern avian flight. Within the first 15 million years of known paravian evolutionary history members of this clade exhibited a difference of nearly four orders of magnitude in body size, a value that is similar to the extreme body size disparity present today in mammalian carnivorans, avians, and varanoid squamates. In this respect, Paraves is an important case study in characterizing the patterns, processes, and dynamics of evolutionary size change. This last point is of particular interest because of the historical significance placed on the role of body size reduction in the origin of powered avian flight. Our study reviews and revises the membership of Dromaeosauridae and provides an apomorphy-based diagnosis for all valid taxa. Of the currently 31 named dromaeosaurid species, we found 26 to be valid. We provide the most detailed and comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of paravians to date in order to explore the phylogenetic history of dromaeosaurid taxa. The general pattern of paravian relationships is explored within the broader context of Coelurosauria with an emphasis on sampling basal avialans, because of their importance for character optimizations at the base of Paraves. A large dataset was constructed by merging two datasets, one examining coelurosaur relationships broadly (based on previous TWiG datasets) and the other examining avialan relationships specifically (Clarke et al., 2006). This merged dataset was then significantly revised and supplemented with novel character analysis focusing on paravian taxa. During character analysis, particular attention was given to basal members of Dromaeosauridae, enigmatic basal paravians such as Jinfengopteryx elegans and Anchiornis huxleyi, and the incorporation of new morphological information from two undescribed troodontid species from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia. A final dataset of 474 characters scored for 111 taxa was used to address paravian evolution. This dataset is important in that it bridges a phylogenetic gap that had persisted between studies on birds and studies on all other coelurosaurs. Most scorings in this matrix were based on the direct observation of specimens. All most parsimonious trees recovered in the cladistic analysis support the monophyly of Paraves, Troodontidae, Dromaeosauridae, and Deinonychosauria. A new clade of basal troodontids is discovered including two undescribed Mongolian troodontids and Jinfengopteryx elegans. Xiaotingia and Anchiornis form a clade at the base of Troodontidae. Recently proposed relationships within Dromaeosauridae are further supported and a succession of clades from Gondwana and Asia form sister taxa to a clade of Laurasian dromaeosaurids. Avialan monophyly is strongly supported with Archaeopteryx, Sapeornis, Jeholornis, and Jixiangornis forming the successive sister taxa to the Confuciusornis node. This topology supports a more basal position for Sapeornis than previous phylogenetic analyses and indicates a progressive acquisition of a fully ?avian? shoulder morphology.}},

A dinosaur from Mongolia represents the basal divergence within Dromaeosauridae. The taxon's small body size and phylogenetic position imply that extreme miniaturization was ancestral for Paraves (the clade including Avialae, Troodontidae, and Dromaeosauridae), phylogenetically earlier than where flight evolution is strongly inferred. In contrast to the sustained small body sizes among avialans throughout the Cretaceous Period, the two dinosaurian lineages most closely related to birds, dromaeosaurids and troodontids, underwent four independent events of gigantism, and in some lineages size increased by nearly three orders of magnitude. Thus, change in theropod body size leading to flight's origin was not unidirectional. 10.1126/science.1144066}},

The holotype specimen is comprised of a well-preserved but partial skull and a nearly complete postcranial skeleton. Mahakala omnogovae is included in a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Coelurosauria using a dataset, which reflects a greatly expanded character set and taxon-sampling regime. Several interesting features of Mahakala omnogovae have implications for deinonychosaurian and avialan character evolution and for understanding patterns of size variation and size change within paravian theropods. These morphologies include the shape of the iliac blade, the triangular obturator process of the ischium, and the evolution of the subarctometatarsalian condition. We present an expanded diagnosis of Mahakala omnogovae, which included following unique combination of characters (autapomorphies noted by *): a ledgelike depression at the confluence of metotic strut and posterior tympanic recess on the anterior face of the paroccipital process*, a posteriorly tapering scapula; a shortened forelimb (humerus 50\% femur length); a strongly compressed and anteroposteriorly broad ulna tapering posteriorly to a narrow edge*; elongate lateral crest on the posterodistal femur*; anterior caudal vertebrae with subhorizontal, laterally directed prezygapophyses*; a prominent supratrochanteric process; and the absence of a cuppedicus fossa.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT The bizarre crocodyliform Simosuchus clarki shares several derived cranial characteristics with basal notosuchian taxa. In the original phylogenetic analysis assessing placement of Simosuchus among other crocodyliforms, it was recovered as a basal notosuchian. Additional preparation of the holotype skull and postcranium, and discovery of additional specimens, provides new information on the suite of morphologies in this notosuchian. Morphological analysis of all available material of S. clarki yields 60 autapomorphies distributed across the skeleton. To provide an updated test of the phylogeny of Notosuchia and placement of Simosuchus within the clade, we added seven new characters and expanded taxon sampling to include recently described notosuchians. A phylogenetic analysis of 301 characters and 84 crocodyliforms supports the position of Simosuchus as sister to Libycosuchus, more derived than Araripesuchus and Uruguaysuchus, and basal to other ziphosuchian notosuchians. We did not recover an Anatosuchus + Simosuchus clade, nor a monophyletic Araripesuchus, but did recover a peirosaurid clade including Peirosaurus, Lomasuchus, Uberabasuchus, and Hamadasuchus (but not Stolokrosaurus). We also found weak support for inclusion of Anatosuchus, Araripesuchus, Peirosauridae, and Mahajangasuchidae within Notosuchia and therefore for the conclusion that all basal mesoeucrocodylians from Gondwana, with the exception of Stolokrosuchus, are notosuchians. The results of this analysis demonstrate that basal mesoeucrocodylian relationships are currently in a state of flux and the need for caution in naming higher-level taxa until a more stable consensus topology is achieved. Similarly, large gaps in the notosuchian record render inconclusive the biogeographic origins of Simosuchus and the clade it represents on Madagascar.}},

High-resolution X-ray CT analysis reveals that its long snout houses an extensive system of pneumatic paranasal cavities. These are among the most distinctive features of modern crocodylians, yet the evolutionary history of this unique system has been obscured by the inaccessibility of internal structures in most fossil crania. Preliminary phylogenetic analysis indicates that the new species is the oldest known member of a monophyletic Goniopholididae, and within this lineage to be the sister taxon of Eutretauranosuchus, from the Late Jurassic Morrison formation of Colorado. Goniopholididae became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous, but it is more closely related to living crocodylians than are several lineages known only from Cretaceous and younger fossils. The new taxon nearly doubles the known length of goniopholid history and implies a deep, as yet undiscovered, Mesozoic history for several crocodyliform lineages that were once thought to have relatively complete fossil records.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Previous cladistic studies of pterosaur relationships suffer from restricted numbers of taxa and characters, incomplete data sets and absence of information on characters, tree structure and the robustness of tress. Parsimony analysis of a new character data set (60 characters, 20 terminal taxa, 97.75\% complete) yielded six trees. In the strict consensus tree Preondactylus is the most basal taxon followed, stepwise, by the Dimorphodontidae and the Anurognathidae. Beyond this basal group, more derived pterosaurs (Campylognathoididae (Rhamphorhynchidae + Pterodactyloidea)) share a suite of characters principally associated with elongation of the rostrum. The Pterodactyloidea consists of four major clades. The Ornithocheiroidea is the most basal taxon consisting, stepwise, of Istiodactylus, the Ornithocheiridae, Nyctosaurus and the Pteranodontidae. The remaining taxa, Ctenochasmatoidea, Dsungaripteroidea and Azhdarchoidea, are weakly united in a clade of non-ornithocheiroid pterodactyloids, but their inter-relationships are difficult to resolve. Cycnorhamphus is the basal-most ctenochasmatoid, while the remaining taxa (Pterodactylus, Lonchodectidae, Ctenochasmatidae) form an unresolved trichotomy. The Dsungaripteroidea (Germanodactylus+Dsungaripteridae) is strongly supported by features of the skull and dentition. The Azhdarchoidea (Tapejara [Tupuxuara + Azhdarchidae]) is united by cranial characters such as elevation of the antorbital region, and relative shortening of the wing finger. The pattern of pterosaur evolution suggested by the results of this analysis is broadly similar to traditional ideas, but has greater resolution, more complexity and reveals several previously unrecognized 'events'.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT The phylogenetic relationships of the Late Cretaceous Mongolian sauropods Nemegtosaurus and Quaesitosaurus are controversial. Previous studies have interpreted nemegtosaurids as members of the Diplodocoidea or Titanosauroidea. The conflicting character sets, which support these alternative hypotheses, are examined and critically evaluated. Only two derived states are unique to nemegtosaurids and one or more titanosauroid taxa. At least five synapomorphies (e.g., transverse narrowing of the rostral end of the premaxilla, elongation of the subnarial foramen, and extreme retraction of the external nares) support the inclusion of the nemegtosaurids within the Diplodocoidea, but the presence of the plesiomorphic state cannot always be confirmed in higher titanosauroids. Cladistic analysis supports the hypothesis that nemegtosaurids are the sister-group to a clade containing Rebbachisaurus, dicraeosaurids and diplodocids. Antarctosaurus wichmannianus, a problematic taxon from the Late Cretaceous of Argentina, is placed within the Diplodocoidea (as the sister-taxon to the Nemegtosauridae) by the analysis. Several lines of evidence suggest, however, that the holotype of A. wichmannianus is composed of an amalgam of different sauropod taxa and does not represent a reliable operational taxonomic unit. The distribution of derived states indicates a considerable amount of convergence between the skulls of diplodocoids and higher titanosauroids. Contrary to previous suggestions, many of the apomorphic features of the diplodocoid skull were acquired gradually and do not represent a single complex character.}},

  Abstract                 = {{A data-matrix of 205 osteological characters for 26 sauropod taxa is subjected to cladistic analysis. Two most parsimonious trees are produced, differing only in the relationships between Euhelopus, Omeisaurus and Mamenchisaurus. The monophyly of the Euhelopodidae (including Shunosaurus) is supported by seven synapomorphies. The Cetiosauridae (Patagosaurus, Cetiosaurus and Haplocanthosaurus) is paraphyletic with respect to the Neosauropoda. The latter clade divides into two major radiations–the 'Brachiosauria' (Camarasaurus, brachiosaurids and titanosauroids), and the Diplodocoidea (nemegtosaurids, dicraeosaurids, diplodocids and Rebbachisaurus). Further evidence for the inclusion of Opisthocoelwaudia in the Titanosauroidea is presented. Phuwiangosaurus, a problematic sauropod from Thailand, may represent one of the most plesiomorphic titanosauroids. 'Peg'-like teeth have evolved at least twice within the Sauropoda. The postspinal lamina, on the neural spines of middle and caudal dorsal vertebrae, represents a neomorph rather than a fusion of pre-existing structures. Forked chevrons may have evolved convergently in the Euhelopodidae and the diplodocid-dicraeosaurid clade, or they may have been acquired early in sauropod evolution and subsequently lost in the 'Brachiosauria'. The strengths and weaknesses of the data-matrix and tree topologies are explored using bootstrapping, decay analysis and randomization tests. Several nodes are only poorly supported, but this seems to reflect the large proportion of missing data in the matrix (∼46\%), rather than an abnormally high level of homoplasy. The results of the randomization tests indicate that the 'data-matrix' probably contains a strong phylogenetic 'signal'. The relationships of some forms, such as Haplocanthosaurus, are influenced by the inclusion or exclusion of certain taxa with unusual combinations of character states. Such a result suggests that there are dangers inherent in the view that 'higher' level sauropod phylogeny can be accurately reconstructed using only a small number of well-known taxa.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Most recent studies of dinosaur phylogeny have concentrated on theropods and ornithischians. As a result, the evolutionary relationships of sauropod dinosaurs are poorly understood. In this paper previous studies of sauropod phylogeny are reviewed and contrasted with the results of a recent cladistic analysis. This analysis forms the basis for a reconstruction of sauropod phylogeny. Sauropods diverged from other dinosaurs at some time in the Upper Triassic, but a large part of their early history is totally unknown. Vulcanodon is currently the most primitive sauropod. Many, but perhaps not all, of the Jurassic Chinese sauropods form a monophyletic radiation (the Euhelopodidae) which may reflect the geographic isolation of China during the Lower Jurassic. Members of the Euhelopodidae, such as Mamenchisaurus, are not considered to be closely related to the Diplodocidae. `Forked' chevrons, which have played such an important role in previous studies of sauropod phylogeny, are here considered to have evolved twice within the Sauropoda. This convergence may reflect a correlation between chevron shape and the use of the tail as a weapon within these two sauropod families. The `Neosauropoda' (sister group to the Euhelopodidae) contains the Brachiosauridae, Camara-sauridae and the new superfamilies Titanosauroidea and Diplodocoidea. The Cetiosauridae (here defined in a rather restricted sense) is also provisionally included within the Neosauropoda, but may be removed in future studies. The enigmatic Upper Cretaceous sauropod, Opisthocoelicaudia, is thought to be the sister taxon to the Titanosauridae and not a camarasaurid as previously suggested. The Diplodocoidea contains two well established families, the Dicraeosauridae and Diplodocidae, and the new family Nemegtosauridae. Finally, an overview of sauropod phylogeny is compared with recently published palaeogeographic reconstructions. There are many difficulties associated with the analysis of sauropod biogeographic distribution. Nevertheless, some aspects of sauropod phylogeny may be linked to the break-up of Laurasia and Gondwanaland during the Jurassic and Cretaceous.}},

Cladistic analysis places Chinshakiangosaurus as one of the most basal sauropods known currently. Mapping of dentary and dental characters onto the most parsimonious topologies yields insights into the sequence of acquisition of a number of feeding-related characters. For example, it seems that basal sauropodomorphs (traditional prosauropod taxa) possessed a fleshy cheek that attached to the mandible along a marked ridge, and that the same structure was present in the most basal sauropods. The early sauropod skull developed a lateral plate that reinforced the bases of the tooth crowns labially, and had wrinkled tooth enamel and a concavity on the mesial portion of the lingual part of each crown, while retaining a fleshy cheek and a relatively weak symphysis. More advanced sauropods (eusauropods) lost the cheek, perhaps in order to increase the gape of the jaws in response to a change in feeding style that involved collection of larger quantities of poor quality foliage.}},

The neural spine is apomorphically short and the centrum is short relative to its height compared to those of other diplodocids, which, when coupled with the specimen's unique geographical location and stratigraphical age, suggests that it probably represents a new taxon. This caudal vertebra provides the first convincing evidence that diplodocids were present in Asia, perhaps as a result of the dispersal of neosauropod lineages from Europe and/or North America during the Early Cretaceous.

The vertebral column displays several autapomorphic features which supplement the generic diagnosis of Cetiosaurus, including: (1) a stout, anteriorly directed process located at the top of the neural spine of the twelfth (?) cervical vertebra; and (2) the presence of lateral pits, separated by a thin midline septum, below the transverse processes of middle dorsal vertebrae. Cladistic analysis indicates that Cetiosaurus is probably the sister–taxon to the advanced neosauropod clade.

  Abstract                 = {{A partial humerus, ulna, and radius compose the type specimen of a new bird, Piksi barbarulna, new genus and species, from the Late Cretaceous (Campanian) Two Medicine Formation of western Montana. This ornithothoracine taxon differs from all other birds in having an enlarged dorsal epicondyle and a reduced ventral condyle on the humerus with corresponding modifications on the articular surface of the ulna. Among modern birds, Piksi is most similar to galliforms, but the paucity of unambiguous characters and its unusual morphology defy placement within any extant "order" and strongly questions any neornithine affinities. Instead, Piksi appears to have a fairly basal position within Ornithothoraces. Several morphologic features of Piksi occur in phylogenetically diverse but morphologically similar birds, such as galliforms, tinamous, and some columbiforms. The new bird comes from an inland, relatively dry paleo-environment. Atypical for a Cretaceous avian record dominated by waterfowl, Piksi appears to represents a heavy-bodied ground bird. Searching of inland depositional environments may yield new and ecologically distinct avian varieties.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Two egg types from the Upper Cretaceous Two Medicine Formation of Montana are described and incorporated into a phylogenetic analysis of egg characters. Small (7.5 ? 3.5 cm), ellipsoidal eggs with a surface ornamentation consisting of isolated round tubercles represent a new, unnamed ootaxon. The microstructure includes narrow, prismatic shell units with three structural layers. The second egg type, oospecies Prismatoolithus levis, belongs to the theropod Troodon formosus. Although previously described, the presence of a third, external layer had been overlooked. Both eggs display several features typical of avian eggs: narrowly spaced nucleation sites, barrel-shaped mammillae with blocky crystal habit, a squamatic-like texture in the prismatic layer, and a third, structural layer. In addition, the new egg type exhibits a cuticle layer and the eggs of Troodon are asymmetric. Cladistic analysis of 14 fossil and extant taxa using 15 egg and shell characters favors a phylogeny consistent with more traditional analyses based on osteologic or genetic data and supports a theropod dinosaur origin for birds. No single character unambiguously distinguishes the eggs of avians from those of non-avian theropods, and the new Two Medicine egg type is recognized simply as that of a theropod. Results also indicate that resemblances in egg characters among non-avian and avian theropods are largely homologous and imply a high-level of similarity in reproductive physiology. Egg features are phylogenetically informative; better classifications and greater utility of eggs and eggshell will be gained through their phylogenetic treatment.}},

  Abstract                 = {{A fossil discovery in the mid-Cretaceous Blackleaf Formation of southwest Montana, USA, has yielded the first trace and body fossil evidence of burrowing behaviour in a dinosaur. Skeletal remains of an adult and two juveniles of Oryctodromeus cubicularis gen. et sp. nov., a new species of hypsilophodont-grade dinosaur, were found in the expanded distal chamber of a sediment-filled burrow. Correspondence between burrow and adult dimensions supports Oryctodromeus as the burrow maker. Additionally, Oryctodromeus exhibits features of the snout, shoulder girdle and pelvis consistent with digging habits while retaining cursorial hindlimb proportions. Association of adult and young within a terminal chamber provides definitive evidence of extensive parental care in the Dinosauria. As with modern vertebrate cursors that dig, burrowing in Oryctodromeus may have been an important adaptation for the rearing of young. Burrowing also represents a mechanism by which small dinosaurs may have exploited the extreme environments of polar latitudes, deserts and high mountain areas. The ability among dinosaurs to find or make shelter may contradict some scenarios of the Cretaceous–Paleogene impact event. Burrowing habits expand the known range of nonavian dinosaur behaviours and suggest that the cursorial ancestry of dinosaurs did not fully preclude the evolution of different functional regimes, such as fossoriality.}},

Disarticulated skull and postcranial bones from two individuals are described as a new taxon, Ukrainurus hypsognathus, gen. et sp. nov. U. hypsognathus is characterized by poorly ossified bone tissues, relatively inflexible mandibles, a high dentary, a crista on the lingual surface of the dentary, a pars dentalis of the dentary that is composed of a dental lamina and a subdental surface, presence of an eminentia dorsalis on the squamosal, a broad pericondylar facet on the occipital, extremely elongated prezygapophyses, and hemal processes with an elongate, oval base. Moreover, U. hypsognathus shows evidence of strong mandibular levator muscles that indicate great biting force. A phylogenetic analysis of all well-understood Tertiary and Recent giant salamanders recovers a monophyletic group of Asian and North American cryptobranchids, but places U. hypsognathus outside crown group Cryptobranchidae. This result suggests that Cryptobranchidae originated in Asia and dispersed to North America. The oldest representative of crown Cryptobranchidae is Aviturus exsecratus from the terminal Paleocene of the Nemegt Basin, Mongolia.

Conophrys fabiani new species occurs in the Early Tremadoc of the western Puna region, northwestern Argentina. Leoforteyia new genus is based on L. hintzei new species from the Ibexian of Utah. Published taxa recognized as new species are Conophrys rushtoni, Conophrys wrighti, Leoforteyia ludvigseni and Shumardia whittingtoni. Phylogenetic analysis suggests the differentiation of Shumardia Billings, 1862; Kweichowilla Chang, 1964; Changchowilla new genus; and Leoforteyia new genus as separate taxa and indicates that Conophrys Callaway, 1877, is a grade group. Silicified material provides a nearly complete growth series for Kweichowilla salasae, including the first protaspides known with confidence for the Shumardiidae. Additionally, ontogenetic material for K. sterrenae, C. sanjuanina, C. riojana (Benedetto and Ca\~{n}as) and C.? carrerai is described. Leoforteyia is restricted to the Ibexian-Whiterockian of western Laurentia; species of Shumardia are widespread in the Arenig to Early Ashgill of western Europe, Australia, Laurentia, China and Russia. Changchowilla is recorded in the mid-Late Arenig-Llanvirn of the Precordillera and in the Llanvirn-middle Caradoc of China. Argentine species of Kweichowilla are closely allied to Australian species, suggesting biogeographic affinities of the Precordillera to the eastern margin of Gondwana by the Llanvirn and Caradoc. Functional morphology, occurrence in fine grained sediments, and association mainly with atheloptic and pelagic trilobites suggest that shumardiids were deposit-feeders that inhabited low light levels in low energy settings, with a limited ability to burrow in soft sediments.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The phylogenetic relationships of species attributed to the ornithopod family Hypsilophodontidae are evaluated using morphological characters from the skull, dentition, and postcranium. Based on our analyses, Hypsilophodontidae constitutes a monophyletic taxon that comprises the sister taxon to Iguanodontia, together forming Euornithopoda. Three clades within the family are consistently demonstrated: Zephyrosaurus schaff+Orodromeus makelai, Parksosaurus warreni+Hypsilophodon foxii and Yandusaurus hongheensis+Othnielia rex. Thescelosaurus neglectus is the sister taxon to these six genera and constitutes the basal hypsilophodontid. Tenontosaurus tilletti is the basal member of Iguanodontia, with species of Dryosaurus and Camptosaurus as higher taxa within the clade. To understand the effects missing data may have on tree topology, tree length, and consistency indices, poorly represented characters were secondarily removed from the character matrix. In these analyses, all relationships remain stable, but tree length and consistency index decrease with increasingly more complete culled data sets. An average of 42.5 million years is accumulated as minimal divergence time for the hypsilophodontid and basal iguanodontian relationships described here. These figures underscore the large amount of hypsilophodontid evolution yet unaccounted for in the fossil record.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Synopsis The dinosaurs of the Hateg Basin of Transylvania (late Maastrichtian; western Romania) include Theropoda, Sauropoda, Ornithopoda and Ankylosauria. Of these, one of the most enigmatic taxa is the ornithopod that Franz Baron Nopcsa originally described as Mochlodon suessi and M. robustus in 1902. These two species have come to be regarded as a single species of Rhabdodon, R. robustus, which is distinct from R. priscus from the Late Cretaceous of southern France and northern Spain. This study provides a detailed anatomical revision of the Rhabdodon material that was described originally by Nopcsa during the early decades of the 20th century. It also adds information on material discovered in the Hateg area of Romania since the 1930s. A phylogenetic analysis of basal euornithopods indicates that the non?hadrosaurid material from Hateg comprises two distinct, but congeneric, species. These two species can be distinguished unambiguously from R. priscus. A new genus Zalmoxes is established for the Romanian ornithopod, comprising Z. robustus comb. nov. (the type?species of the genus) and Z. shqiperorum sp. nov. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the two species of Zalmoxes and R. priscus are united in the monophyletic clade Rhabdodontidae (nov.). Rhabdodontidae constitutes the sibling clade to Iguanodontia. R. septimanicus, M. suessi, and the Villeveyrac Rhabdodon also appear to be members of Rhabdodontidae. The evolutionary implications of this phylogenetic analysis include the recognition of a ghost lineage, extending from the most recent common ancestor of Rhabdodontidae and Iguanodontia, which extends for 73 million years. This extraordinarily long ghost lineage duration may reflect considerable gaps in the history of this group or the geographical isolation of Rhabdodontidae in Europe during much of the Cretaceous period. The area of origin of the Rhabdodontidae + Iguanodontia clade may be North America, while the common ancestor of Rhabdodontidae dispersed to Europe, at that time a marine?dominated region with tectonically?active terrestrial habitats. Adult individuals of Z. robustus are smaller than either of its two closest relatives, Z. shqiperorum and R. priscus, within the Rhabdodontidae, or with many species of Iguanodontia and, therefore, is considered a possible paedomorphic dwarf.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The fossil record of coelacanths is patchy, with very few taxa known from the Triassic of Asia. We report here two new genera and species of coelacanths from the Luoping Biota, a recently found site of exceptional fossil preservation from Yunnan, South China. The first new taxon, Luopingcoelacanthus eurylacrimalis, is based on four specimens, which together show most aspects of the anatomy. One specimen shows two small coelacanths inside the ventral portion of the abdominal cavity, and these are interpreted as intrauterine embryos, close to birth size, based on comparisons with previously reported embryos of the fossil coelacanths Rhabdoderma and Undina, and the extant genus Latimeria. Our new find extends the evidence for ovoviviparity in coelacanths back from the Late Jurassic to the Middle Triassic. The second new taxon, Yunnancoelacanthus acrotuberculatus, is based on one specimen, and differs from Luopingcoelacanthus in the dentary, lachrymojugal, number of rays of the first dorsal fin, and especially in the ornament on dermal bones and scales. A cladistic analysis shows that the new taxa are closest relatives to the derived clade Latimerioidei. The relatively high diversity of coelacanths in the Early Triassic, and adaptations of living Latimeria to low-oxygen conditions, suggests that the group may have included ?disaster taxa? that benefited from anoxic and dysoxic ocean conditions in the aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction.}},

Rebellatrix divaricerca, gen. et sp. nov., is unique among coelacanths in its possession of a bifurcated caudal fin, reduced segmentation of fin rays, and fusion of caudal fin elements. Parsimony analysis of a character-taxon matrix of 109 characters and 29 taxa recovered R. divaricerca as sister taxon to Latimerioidei. The family Rebellatricidae is erected to include only R. divaricerca. This novel body shape of the new coelacanth raises questions about the idea that coelacanths were morphologically static following the Mississippian. Rebellatrix divaricerca also emphasizes the morphological diversity of coelacanths during the Early Triassic, a time when species diversity of coelacanths was also highest. The slender, fork-tailed body form suggests fast swimming and an active lifestyle, unique among known fossil and extant coelacanths.}},

Cladistic analysis of species assigned to Dimeropygidae supports the monophyly of a clade including Dimeropyge, Dimeropygiella, Ischyrotoma, Pseudohystricurus and Pseudopetigurus, which may represent a subfamily Dimeropyginae. The distribution of Dimeropyginae shows a predominantly palaeotropical distribution, while the Gondwana Pseudopetigurus must have diverged from the dimeropygine common ancestor in pre-Arenigian time.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The phylogeny of the extant chelicerate orders is examined in the light of morphological and molecular evidence. Representatives from each of the chelicerate 'orders' and mandibulate and onychophoran outgroups are examined. Molecular (small and large ribosomal subunit DNA) and morphological information is combined in a total evidence regime to determine the most consistent picture of extant chelicerate relationships for these data. Multiple phylogenetic analyses are performed with variable analysis parameters yielding largely consistent results. A normalized incongruence length metric is used to assay the relative merit of the multiple analyses. The combined analysis with lowest character incongruence yields the scheme of relationships (Pycnogonida+ (Xiphosura+((Opiliones+((Solifugae+Pseudoscorpiones)+Scorpiones))+((Ricinulei+Acari)+(Palpigradi+ ((Thelyphonida+Schizomida=Uropygi)+(Amblypygi+ Araneae))))))). This result is fairly robust to variation in analysis parameters, with the placement of solifugids and the status of the pedipalps responsible for most disagreement.}},

The holotype and paratype materials of A. bohetii are re-examined and found to have closer affinities with Brachiosaurus and relatives than with any diplodocoid. The presence of a second titanosauriform sauropod in the Tanzanian fauna is important for understanding the palaeoecology of the region. Comparisons between Tendaguru and three other contemporaneous sauropod faunas (Morrison Formation, USA; Lourinh\~{a} and Alcoba\c{c}a formations, Portugal; Ca\~{n}ad\'{o}n Calc\'{a}reo, Argentina) are also made. The revised Tendaguru fauna, with its high diversity of high-browsing Macronarians, now more closely matches the conifer-forest dominated landscape inferred from palaeobotanical evidence. The Morrison Formation, dominated by low-browse, is once again the only formation containing multiple diplodocids.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Diplodocoidea includes some of the first well-known sauropod dinosaurs, including such late 19th century and early 20th century discoveries as Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, and Dicraeosaurus. As a consequence of their long history of study, the basic set of suprageneric diplodocoid interrelationships is well resolved, and the diagnostic features of each genus are well established. However, intergeneric relationships are less resolved, including the relationships of putatively basal taxa like Amphicoelias and Haplocanthosaurus, the flagellicaudatan Suuwassea, and the highly specialized rebbachisaurids. For the rebbachisaurids, this uncertainty is coupled with a recent surge in the discovery of new taxa. Comparative cladistic methods demonstrate that character and taxon sampling need to be improved before greater phylogenetic resolution can be expected. Here, I present a new phylogenetic analysis that resolves many of the outstanding questions regarding the relationships within Diplodocoidea and examines palaeobiogeographical trends within the group. Suuwassea is recovered as a basal dicraeosaurid (the only Laurasian member of the group), and two distinct clades of rebbachisaurids are identified: a group closely allied with Nigersaurus and a clade associated with Limaysaurus. Amphicoelias, Amazonsaurus, and Haplocanthosaurus are provisionally placed as successively less-derived taxa at the base of Diplodocoidea. A North American origin for Diplodocoidea and Flagellicaudata is hypothesized based on the geographical and temporal distribution of those taxa. Rebbachisaurid taxa demonstrate a South American/African vicariance pattern, but the timing of the event pre-dates the proposed final rifting of those continents by c. 40 million years; the meaning of this discrepancy is uncertain. {\copyright} 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 161, 872–915.}},

  Abstract                 = {{10.1098/rstb.1996.0001 Application of optimality criteria, such as parsimony, for choosing among phylogenetic hypotheses sometimes yields multiple optimal solutions, necessitating the application of additional methodology. Phylogeneticists may adopt a conservative strategy of presenting only a summary of the multiple trees and/or they may attempt to further discriminate among them. Parsimony analysis of data for Sphenodon and its fossil relatives yields multiple trees and is used to illustrate and compare a variety of approaches for summarizing agreement and selecting among trees. Multiple trees may result from a lack of evidence or character incongruence. Only with the latter can techniques to discriminate among optimal trees be effective. Adoption of secondary optimality criteria depends on the same rationale as differential character weighting and is a poor substitute for weighting. Neither approach will necessarily solve the problem of multiple trees or remove the need for methods that summarize agreement among them. Many consensus methods produce summaries of optimal trees that are far from ideal. Reduced consensus methods and disqualifier faithful subtrees may have advantages over the alternatives. Safe taxonomic reduction may also reduce problems of multiple trees due to lack of evidence, and the experimental pruning of taxa provides a powerful technique for investigating agreement among multiple trees. Some consensus and weighting methods are sensitive to the treatment of arbitrary resolutions which presents some unsolved difficulties in their use and interpretation. Multiple analyses using modern techniques provide a more resolved hypothesis of sphenodontid interrelationships and a better understanding of remaining problems than previous studies.}},

These tissues are commonly found as isolated elements in the fossil record and studied as three separate partitions: the dentition, the cranium, and the postcranium. The relative phylogenetic utility of characters from each partition is often called into question with respect to varying amounts of homoplasy. In this paper, the consistency index (CI) was used to measure levels of homoplasy in each data partition for a sample of fossil and living primates. Sources of bias in the collection and treatment of data and in the internal structure of the data set are addressed. These biases include number of taxa, number of characters, ordering of characters, amounts of polymorphically scored or missing data, and character-state distribution. The results of this study suggest that the levels of homoplasy are very similar, though the postcranial data may be slightly less homoplastic than either the dental or cranial data.}},

It represents a new genus and species, Sphaerotholus goodwini. A new species, S. buchholtzae, from the upper Maastrichtian Hell Creek Formation of Montana is referred to this genus. Additional New Mexico pachycephalosaurians include a partial dentary with associated skull material that is tentatively referred to S. goodwini and a partial frontoparietal that is referred to Pachycephalosauridae incertae sedis. On the basis of a hypothetical growth series of Stegoceras, we excluded characters based on dome development and suture closure from a cladistic analysis of pachycephalosaurian relationships. Ornatotholus browni, the only putative ?flat-headed? pachycephalosaurian from North America, is considered a nomen dubium and may represent a juvenile Stegoceras. Gravitholus albertae is an adult Stegoceras sp.; Stegoceras edmontonense is a nomen dubium and is referred to cf. Sphaerotholus sp. Based on the results of a quantitative cladistic analysis, Stegoceras (including Stegoceras breve, S. lambei, S. stembergi, and UCMP 130051) is the sister taxon to all other domed pachycephalosaurians. Derived pachycephalosaurids consist of two principal clades: a lineage that includes Stygimoloch, Pachycephalosaurus, and Sphaerotholus and a lineage represented by the Asian taxa, Tylocephale and Prenocephale. With biogeographic occurrences mapped onto the phytogeny, a single dispersal event from Asia into North America, followed by dispersal of Prenocephale and Tylocephale into Asia prior to the late Campanian is indicated (ACCTRAN) or two independent dispersals into North America prior to the late Campanian is indicated (DELTRAN). Pachycephalosaurian phylogeny does not support Asian-North American contiguity throughout the Campanian and Maastrichtian.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Priapulids and their extinct relatives, the archaeopriapulids and palaeoscolecids, are vermiform, carnivorous ecdysozoans with an armoured, extensible proboscis. These worms were an important component of marine communities during the Palaeozoic, but were especially abundant and diverse in the Cambrian. Today, they comprise just seven genera in four families. Priapulids were among the first groups used to test hypotheses concerning the morphological disparity of Cambrian fossils relative to the extant fauna. A previous study sampled at the generic level, concluding that Cambrian genera embodied marginally less morphological diversity than their extant counterparts. Here, we sample predominantly at the species level and include numerous fossils and some extant forms described in the last fifteen years. Empirical morphospaces for priapulids, archaeopriapulids and palaeoscolecids are relatively insensitive to changes in the taxon or character sample: their overall form has altered little, despite the markedly improved sampling. Cambrian and post-Cambrian genera occupy adjacent rather than broadly overlapping regions of these spaces, and Cambrian species still show lower morphological disparity than their post-Cambrian counterparts. Crucially, the significance of this difference has increased with improved taxon sampling over research time. In contrast with empirical morphospaces, the phylogeny of priapulids, archaeopriapulids and palaeoscolecids derived from morphological characters is extremely sensitive to details of taxon sampling and the manner in which characters are weighted. However, the extant Priapulidae and Halicryptidae invariably resolve as sister families, with this entire clade subsequently being sister group to the Maccabeidae. In our most inclusive trees, the extant Tubiluchidae are separated from these other living taxa by a number of small, intervening fossil clades.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract Fossil vertebrate distributions are typically based on body fossils, which are often poorly sampled at the margins of their true temporal and spatial ranges. Because vertebrate ichnofossils can be preserved in great abundance and in different environments than vertebrate body fossils, inclusion of ichnofossil data may improve sampled ranges. However, if ichnofossils are to serve as an independent source of distributional data, then their attribution to a body fossil group (i.e., trackmaker identification) cannot rely on temporal and spatial coincidence. Ichnofossils identified by synapomorphies can act as an independent source of distributional data that can modify spatial, temporal, and character distributions, which in turn may influence hypotheses of locomotor evolution. In this paper I evaluate the spatial, temporal, and character distributions of early sauropod dinosaurs by using a combined ichnofossil and body fossil data set. Sauropod ichnofossils supplement the spatiotemporal distributions of early sauropods and provide important information on early sauropod foot posture that is rarely preserved or can only be inferred from body fossils. The presence of derived features in early-appearing ichnofossils challenges previous hypotheses of character transformation, implying either parallelism, reversal, or ghost lineages. Stratocladistics can be used to resolve conflicting character and temporal distributions from body fossils and ichnofossils. Stratocladistic analysis of a combined ichnofossil and body fossil data set suggests a richer, more widely distributed diversity of early sauropods than currently recognized in body fossils and suggests that several locomotor characters originated much earlier than implied by body fossils.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Sauropoda is among the most diverse and widespread dinosaurlineages, having attained a near-global distribution by the MiddleJurassic that was built on throughout the Cretaceous. These giganticherbivores are characterized by numerous skeletal specializationsthat accrued over a 140 million-year history. This fascinating evolutionaryhistory has fuelled interest for more than a century, yet aspectsof sauropod interrelationships remain unresolved. This paper presentsa lower-level phylogenetic analysis of Sauropoda in two parts. First,the two most comprehensive analyses of Sauropoda are critiqued toidentify points of agreement and difference and to create a coreof character data for subsequent analyses. Second, a generic-levelphylogenetic analysis of 234 characters in 27 sauropod taxa is presentedthat identifies well supported nodes as well as areas of poorerresolution. The analysis resolves six sauropod outgroups to Neosauropoda,which comprises the large-nostrilled clade Macronaria and the peg-toothedclade Diplodocoidea. Diplodocoidea includes Rebbachisauridae, Dicraeosauridae,and Diplodocidae, whose monophyly and interrelationships are supportedlargely by cranial and vertebral synapomorphies. In contrast, thearrangement of macronarians, particularly those of titanosaurs,are based on a preponderance of appendicular synapomorphies. The purportedChinese clade 'Euhelopodidae' is shown to comprisea polyphyletic array of basal sauropods and neosauropods. The synapomorphiessupporting this topology allow more specific determination for themore than 50 fragmentary sauropod taxa not included in this analysis.Their distribution and phylogenetic affinities underscore the diversityof Titanosauria and the paucity of Late Triassic and Early Jurassicgenera. The diversification of Titanosauria during the Cretaceousand origin of the sauropod body plan duringthe Late Triassic remain frontiers for future studies. {\\copyright} 2002The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the LinneanSociety, 2002, 136, 217−276.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Although sauropods played a major role in terrestrial ecosystems during much of the Mesozoic Era, little effort has been directed toward diagnosing Sauropoda and establishing higher-level interrelationships among sauropods. As a consequence, the origin and evolution of major skeletal adaptations in sauropods has remained largely speculative. The cladistic analysis presented here focuses on higher-level relationships among sauropods. Based on 109 characters (32 cranial, 24 axial, 53 appendicular) for 10 sauropod taxa, the most parsimonious arrangement places four genera (Vulcanodon, Shunosaurus, Barapasaurus, and Omeisaurus) as a sequence of sister-taxa to a group of advanced sauropods, defined here as Neosauropoda. Neosauropoda, in turn, is composed of the sister-clades Diplodocoidea and Macronaria; the latter is a new taxon that includes Haplocanthosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Titanosauriformes. Titanosauriformes includes Brachiosauridae and Somphospondyli, a new taxon uniting Euhelopus and Titanosauria. Among macronarians, the position of Haplocanthosaurus is the least stable as a result of the absence of cranial remains. The basic structure of the phylogeny is resilient to various tests and establishes the evolutionary sequence of many functionally significant sauropod adaptations, such as the digitigrade posture of the manus in neosauropods. Other characteristic sauropod adaptations, such as narrow tooth crowns, increases in length and number of cervical vertebrae, and bifid neural spines, are shown to have evolved more than once. As these results underscore, the higher-level phylogeny of sauropods must be based on a broad sampling of character data. The fossil record of sauropods, although relatively limited during the early phase of the radiation (Late Triassic through Early Jurassic), nonetheless indicates that all major clades were established prior to the Late Jurassic, when substantial faunal interchange among major continental regions was still possible. The functional, temporal, and biogeographic implications of the higher-level phylogeny of sauropods are explored.}},

  Abstract                 = {{SYNOPSISEuhelopus zdanskyi was the first dinosaur described from China. Both traditional and modern cladistic assessments have found support for an endemic clade of Chinese sauropods (Euhelopodidae) that originated during an interval of geographic isolation, but the monophyly of this clade has remained controversial. The phylogenetic affinity of the eponymous genus Euhelopus is central to this controversy, yet its anatomy has not been completely restudied since the original German-language monograph in 1929.We jointly re-examined the cranial and postcranial anatomy of the holotypic and referred materials of Euhelopus to provide a new diagnosis for the genus and to explore its phylogenetic affinities. Diagnostic features of Euhelopus include: postaxial cervical vertebrae that have variably developed epipophyses and more subtle ” pre-epipopophyses” below the prezygapophyses; cervical neural arches with an epipophyseal–prezygapophyseal lamina separating two pneumatocoels; anterior cervical vertebrae with three costal spurs on the tuberculum and capitulum; divided middle presacral neural spines, which in anterior dorsal vertebrae bear a median tubercle that is as large or larger than the metapophyses; middle and posterior dorsal parapophyseal and diapophyseal laminae arranged in a ” K” configuration; and presacral pneumaticity that extends into the ilium. Following this morphological study, we rescored Euhelopus for the two most comprehensive sauropod data matrices (Wilson 2002; Upchurch et al. 2004a), which previously yielded vastly different hypotheses for its relationships. Both matrices decisively demonstrate that Euhelopus is closely related to Titanosauria; traditional and cladistic claims that Euhelopus, Omeisaurus, Mamenchisaurus and Shunosaurus formed a monophyletic ” Euhelopodidae” endemic to East Asia are not supported. These results suggest that there were at least two clades of very long-necked sauropods in East Asia, occurring in the Middle Jurassic (i.e. Omeisaurus + Mamenchisaurus) and Early Cretaceous (e.g. Euhelopus, Erketu), with the latter group perhaps also occurring in Europe (Canudo et al. 2002). It is probable that the Euhelopus + Erketu lineage invaded East Asia from another part of Pangaea when isolation ended in the Early Cretaceous. The large number of basal titanosauriforms from East Asia has been interpreted to mean that this area may represent their centre of origin (You et al. 2003), but the titanosaur fossil record and phylogenetic studies indicate that the group probably originated prior to the Middle Jurassic and acquired a virtually global distribution before Pangaean fragmentation.}},

Its salmonine relationship is supported by eight derived features: (1) posterior part of frontal widely expanded above autosphenotic, (2) hyomandibular fossa on pterotic long, (3) posterior part of endopterygoid extending posteriorly and broadly overlapped by both metapterygoid and quadrate, (4) premaxillary process of maxilla extending dorsally at an angle larger than 10o, (5) infraorbitals 3 to 5 narrow and covering less than anterior half of hyomandibula, (6) presence of suprapreopercle, (7) anterior end of preopercular canal on horizontal arm distinctiy turning to anteroventral corner of preopercle, (8) first uroneural amplified into large fan-shaped stegural, and (9) scales small, with more fhan two lateral line scales per vertebral centrum. Salmonidae are a monophyletic family defined by at least three synapomorphies: posterior surface of epiotic with sulcus, peg-and-socket connection in caudal skeleton, and tetraploid karyotype.

Our analysis recovered {dagger}Lycoptera, {dagger}Paralycoptera+ {dagger}Tanolepis, and {dagger}Xixiaichthys as stem-group osteoglossomorphs, {dagger}Singida as sister to Pantodon within Osteoglossidae, {dagger}Chauliopareion as a stem osteoglossid, {dagger}Ostariostoma as a stem osteoglossiform, and Notopteridae as sister to Mormyroidea and {dagger}Palaeonotopterus. These results do not lend themselves to easy explanations of osteoglossomorph biogeography involving either dispersal from a centre of origin or vicariant division of a widely distributed ancestor. Recent suggestions of an ancient (Palaeozoic) origin for osteoglossomorphs are flawed. The evidence, instead, is consistent with an origin within the Mesozoic and the biogeographic explanation involves extensive extinction of clades from continents where they occurred in the past. 10.1144/SP295.12},

  Abstract                 = {{The skull of the Cretaceous pterosaur Istiodactylus latidens, a historically important species best known for its broad muzzle of interlocking, lancet-shaped teeth, is almost completely known from the broken remains of several individuals, but the length of its jaws remains elusive. Estimates of I. latidens jaw length have been exclusively based on the incomplete skull of NHMUK R3877 and, perhaps erroneously, reconstructed by assuming continuation of its broken skull pieces as preserved in situ. Here, an overlooked jaw fragment of NHMUK R3877 is redescribed and used to revise the skull reconstruction of I. latidens. The new reconstruction suggests a much shorter skull than previously supposed, along with a relatively tall orbital region and proportionally slender maxilla, a feature documented in the early 20th century but ignored by all skull reconstructions of this species. These features indicate that the skull of I. latidens is particularly distinctive amongst istiodactylids and suggests greater disparity between I. latidens and I. sinensis than previously appreciated. A cladistic analysis of istiodactylid pterosaurs incorporating new predicted I. latidens skull metrics suggests Istiodactylidae is constrained to five species (Liaoxipterus brachyognathus, Lonchengpterus zhoai, Nurhachius ignaciobritoi, Istiodactylus latidens and Istiodactylus sinensis) defined by their distinctive dentition, but excludes the putative istiodactylids Haopterus gracilis and Hongshanopterus lacustris. Istiodactylus latidens, I. sinensis and Li. brachyognathus form an unresolved clade of derived istiodactylids, and the similarity of comparable remains of I. sinensis and Li. brachyognathus suggest further work into their taxonomy and classification is required. The new skull model of I. latidens agrees with the scavenging habits proposed for these pterosaurs, with much of their cranial anatomy converging on that of habitually scavenging birds.}},

  Abstract                 = {{A skeleton of a new ceratopsid dinosaur, Eotriceratops xerinsularis gen. et sp. nov., is described in this paper. It is the first associated vertebrate skeleton found within the upper 20 m of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. Eotriceratops xerinsularis is a large chasmosaurine that differs from other chasmosaurines in a unique set of features in the premaxilla, nasal horn core, squamosal frill, and epijugal. The most striking of those features includes an extremely tall, non-recessed narial process of the premaxilla; the presence of greatly elongate, spindle-shaped epoccipitals on the squamosal frill; a deep, well-demarcated fossa on the anteroventral surface of the squamosal frill; a sharply conical epijugal with a pronounced proximoposterior process and separate fossa-like facets for the jugal and quadratojugal; and the presence of an obliquely extending vascular trace meeting a transverse vascular trace ventrally on the anterior surface of the nasal horn core. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that E. xerinsularis is nested within a clade including Triceratops, Diceratops, and Torosaurus, which are all from late Maastrichtian deposits. The upper 20 m of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation comprises a coal-rich interval (Carbon?Thompson coal zone, unit 5), which previously has been assigned to upper Maastrichtian magnetochrons 31n and 30r, and the Mancicorpus gibbus miospore subzone. The ceratopsid specimen was collected from between the Carbon and Thompson coal seams, and thus, is inferred to (1) occur near the top of magnetochron 31n and (2) have an age of 67.6?68.0 Ma. Large chasmosaurine ceratopsids, such as Triceratops and Torosaurus, have not previously been described from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation or from magnetochron 31n or the M. gibbus miospore subzone. Thus, Eotriceratops is distinctly older than any other ceratopsid in the Triceratops group, and the discovery of E. xerinsularis helps fill a biostratigraphic gap between early and late Maastrichtian chasmosaurines.}},

S. chuhsienensis, from the ?Upper Jurassic deposits of Shandong province, eastern China, is re-examined. Shantungosuchus is primarily distinguished from all other crocodyliforms by a short premaxilla/maxillary portion of the skull, a transversely broad shelf of the jugal ventral to the orbit, a pair of posterolaterally divergent ridges on the pterygoid, a pair of large basisphenoid depressions, the exclusion of the angular from posterolateral surface of the mandible, and the superficially asymmetrical appearance of the two dentaries in the symphysial region. Shantungosuchus is probably also unique in possessing a quadratojugal fossa, a leaf-shaped palatine separated from the suborbital fenestra, a pronounced coronoid projection of the surangular, and a tibia longer than the femur. A phylogenetic analysis of the early crocodyliforms represented by better preserved material tentatively indicates that the Protosuchia is monophyletic and strongly suggests that Shantungosuchus is closely related to the Protosuchidae rather than to the Atoposauridae of the ?Mesosuchia.?}},

The specific diagnosis of T. robusta and the generic diagnosis of Terminonaris are established. Terminonaris robusta differs from the type species T. browni mainly in size-related features. Teleorhinus mesabiensis Erickson, 1969 is placed into the synonymy of Terminonaris robusta. The genus can be diagnosed by features of the anterior end of the snout, suturai relationships of the bones surrounding the orbit, and the structure of the occiput. A phylogenetic analysis based upon data drawn from the new material suggests that Terminonaris is not a pholidosaurid but is, instead, closely related to Dyrosaurus.

It also possesses a number of unusual cranial features including a shelf-like anterolateral expansion of the jugal, a distinct lateral process on the angular, a very small splenial, and an entirely open Meckelian canal. As in Notosuchus terrestris from the Upper Cretaceous of Argentina, the confluent external nares are large, vertically oriented, and face directly forward. Mandibular motion was apparently proal. Phylogenetic analysis indicates a sister-group relationship between Chimaerasuchus and Notosuchus, and between that clade and an as yet unnamed notosuchid from the Lower Cretaceous of Malawi. This casts further doubts on previous claims concerning the endemic distribution of the Notosuchidae and other ?Gondwanan? tetrapod taxa during the Cretaceous.}},

The beds yielding the type material are correlated with the Neospathodus homeri–N. triangularis Conodont zone. The new taxon is most similar to Chaohusaurus geishanensis Young and Dong, 1972 in the shape and configuration of the scapula, forefin, pelvic girdle and hindfin, presacral vertebral count and well-developed caudal peak, but distinguished from the latter by its larger size, the position of the pineal foramen in the centre of the parietal, the occurrence of a larger calcaneum in hindfin and the first sacral rib with distal expansion. The new species exhibits common features of primitive ichthyosaurs such as: (1) the prefrontal has an antero-dorsal shelf projecting towards the orbit; (2) the upper temporal fenestra is small; (3) the postorbital and the squamosal meet laterally to the upper temporal fenestra; and (4) cylindrical centra. However, more derived ichthyosaur characters are seen with the frontal separated from the orbital dorsal margin by the contact of the prefrontal and postfrontal, which offer new clues to the early radiation of ichthyosaurs.}},

The discovery documents a new record of this group, which is significantly older than other known scanilepiforms from China, and is slightly younger than Evenkia from the Lowest Triassic of Central Siberia. Although the Beishan beds were previously interpreted as Late Permian in age, based on megaplant fossils, this new discovery supports the reinterpretation of the deposits as Early Triassic in age, based on vertebrate fossils from the same locality and horizon. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted to resolve the relationships of Scanilepiformes with other actinopterygian clades, and the inter-relationships within Scanilepiformes. Contrary to previous thought that scanilepiforms are closely related to the Amiidae, the phylogenetic results of this study recognize the Scanilepiformes as stem-group neopterygians. Relationships of the Scanilepiformes and Australosomus with other neopterygians remain unresolved. With a characteristic long-based dorsal fin, scanilepiforms represent a small group that emerged in Early Triassic freshwater environments, inhabited Eurasia and North America during the Middle–Late Triassic, briefly invaded the marine environment by the Late Triassic in Europe, and became extinct at the end of Triassic. {\copyright} 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 161, 595–612.}},

Incisivosaurus has a pair of premaxillary teeth resembling rodent incisors and small, lanceolate cheek teeth with large wear facets. These dental features were previously unknown among theropods and suggest a herbivorous diet.

  Abstract                 = {{The tyrannosauroid fossil record is mainly restricted to Cretaceous sediments of Laurasia, although some very fragmentary Jurassic specimens have been referred to this group1, 2. Here we report a new basal tyrannosauroid, Guanlong wucaii gen. et sp. nov., from the lower Upper Jurassic of the Junggar Basin3, 4, northwestern China. G. wucaii is the oldest known tyrannosauroid and shows several unexpectedly primitive pelvic features5, 6. Nevertheless, the limbs of G. wucaii share several features with derived coelurosaurs7, 8, 9, and it possesses features shared by other coelurosaurian clades10. This unusual combination of character states provides an insight into the poorly known early radiation of the Coelurosauria. Notably, the presumed predatory Guanlong has a large, fragile and highly pneumatic cranial crest that is among the most elaborate known in any non-avian dinosaur and could be comparable to some classical exaggerated ornamental traits among vertebrates.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Theropods have traditionally been assumed to have lost manual digits from the lateral side inward, which differs from the bilateral reduction pattern seen in other tetrapod groups. This unusual reduction pattern is clearly present in basal theropods, and has also been inferred in non-avian tetanurans based on identification of their three digits as the medial ones of the hand (I-II-III). This contradicts the many developmental studies indicating II-III-IV identities for the three manual digits of the only extant tetanurans, the birds. Here we report a new basal ceratosaur from the Oxfordian stage of the Jurassic period of China (156–161 million years ago), representing the first known Asian ceratosaur and the only known beaked, herbivorous Jurassic theropod. Most significantly, this taxon possesses a strongly reduced manual digit I, documenting a complex pattern of digital reduction within the Theropoda. Comparisons among theropod hands show that the three manual digits of basal tetanurans are similar in many metacarpal features to digits II-III-IV, but in phalangeal features to digits I-II-III, of more basal theropods. Given II-III-IV identities in avians, the simplest interpretation is that these identities were shared by all tetanurans. The transition to tetanurans involved complex changes in the hand including a shift in digit identities, with ceratosaurs displaying an intermediate condition.}},

Several studies have linked the Heterodontosauridae with either the Ceratopsia or Marginocephalia, but evidence for these relationships is weak, leading most recent studies to consider the Heterodontosauridae as the basal member of another major ornithischian radiation, the Ornithopoda. Here, we report on a new basal ceratopsian dinosaur, Yinlong downsi gen. et. sp. nov., from the Late Jurassic upper part of the Shishugou Formation of Xinjiang, China. This new ceratopsian displays a series of features transitional between more derived ceratopsians and other ornithischians, shares numerous derived similarities with both the heterodontosaurids and pachycephalosaurians and provides strong evidence supporting a monophyletic Marginocephalia and its close relationship to the Heterodontosauridae. Character distributions along the marginocephalian lineage reveal that, compared to the bipedal Pachycephalosauria, which retained a primitive post-cranial body-plan, the dominantly quadrupedal ceratopsians lost many marginocephalian features and evolved their own characters early in their evolution.}},

The enlargement of manual digit II in alvarezsauroids and the concurrent reduction of the lateral digits have been interpreted as adaptations for digging, although no detailed biomechanical analysis of hand function has so far been carried out for this group. In the derived alvarezsauroid clade Parvicursorinae, the lateral digits are so small as to be presumably vestigial. Here we report a new alvarezsauroid, Linhenykus monodactylus gen. et sp. nov., based on a specimen from the Upper Cretaceous Wulansuhai Formation of Inner Mongolia, China. Cladistic analysis identifies Linhenykus as the most basal parvicursorine, and digit II of the manus retains a slender morphology and other primitive features. However, Linhenykus is also highly apomorphic in exhibiting the most extreme reduction of the lateral manual digits seen in any alvarezsauroid. Phalanges are retained only on the most medial digit (digit II), making Linhenykus the only known functionally monodactyl nonavian dinosaur. Other parvicursorines are more primitive in retaining a tridactyl manus but more derived in that digit II is highly robust and shows other apomorphic features in both of its phalanges. The unexpected combination of features seen in the hand of Linhenykus points to a complex mosaic pattern of manual evolution in alvarezsauroids, with loss of the presumably vestigial outer digits being decoupled from change in the form of digit II.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The Troodontidae represents one of the most bird-like theropod groups and plays an important role in our understanding of avian origins. Although troodontids have been known for over 150 years, few known derived troodontid specimens preserve significant portions of both the forelimb and the hindlimb. Here, we report a new troodontid taxon, Linhevenator tani gen. et sp. nov., based on a partial, semi-articulated skeleton recovered from the Upper Cretaceous Wulansuhai Formation of Wulatehouqi, Inner Mongolia, China. L. tani has an unusual combination of primitive and derived character states, though our phylogenetic analysis places it in a derived clade within the Troodontidae. As a derived taxon, L. tani has a dromaeosaurid-like pedal digit II, and this species also possesses a humerus that is proportionally much shorter and more robust than those of most other troodontids. The combination of features present in Linhevenator indicates a complex pattern of character evolution within the Troodontidae. In particular, the discovery of Linhevenator suggests that derived troodontids have independently evolved a highly specialized pedal digit II and have significantly shortened the forelimb over the course of their evolution.}},

Here we report on a new non-avian dinosaur, Gigantoraptor erlianensis, gen. et sp. nov., from the Late Cretaceous Iren Dabasu Formation of Nei Mongol, China. Although it has a body mass of about 1,400 kg, a phylogenetic analysis positions this new taxon within the Oviraptorosauria, a group of small, feathered theropods rarely exceeding 40 kg in body mass2, 4, 5, 6, 7. A histological analysis suggests that Gigantoraptor gained this size by a growth rate considerably faster than large North American tyrannosaurs such as Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus8. Gigantoraptor possesses several salient features previously unknown in any other dinosaur and its hind limb bone scaling and proportions are significantly different from those of other coelurosaurs9, 10, thus increasing the morphological diversity among dinosaurs. Most significantly, the gigantic Gigantoraptor shows many bird-like features absent in its smaller oviraptorosaurian relatives, unlike the evolutionary trend seen in many other coelurosaurian subgroups2, 3.}},

Here we describe a new therizinosauroid from the Yixian Formation (Early Cretaceous, Liaoning, China)13. This new taxon provides fresh evidence that therizinosauroids are nested within the coelurosaurian theropods8, 9, 10, 11. Our analysis suggests that several specialized therizinosauroid characters, such as the Sauropodomorpha-like tetradactyl pes1,2, evolved independently within this group. Most interestingly, this new dinosaur has integumentary filaments as in Sinosauropteryx 14,15. This indicates that such feather-like structures may have a broad distribution among non-avian theropods, and supports the hypothesis that the filamentous integumentary structures may be homologous to the feathers of birds14,15.}},

Sinornithosaurus not only greatly increases our knowledge of Dromaeosauridae but also provides evidence for a filamentous integument in this group. It is remarkably similar to early birds postcranially. The shoulder girdle shows that terrestrial dromaeosaurids had attained the prerequisites for powered, flapping flight6, supporting the idea that bird flight originated from the ground up7, 8. The discovery of Sinornithosaurus widens the distribution of integumentary filaments among non-avian theropods5, 9, 10. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that, among known theropods with integumentary filaments or feathers2, 5, Dromaeosauridae is the most bird-like, and is more closely related to birds than is Troodontidae.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The unusual presence of long pennaceous feathers on the feet of basal dromaeosaurid dinosaurs has recently been presented as strong evidence in support of the arboreal–gliding hypothesis for the origin of bird flight, but it could be a unique feature of dromaeosaurids and thus irrelevant to the theropod–bird transition. Here, we report a new eumaniraptoran theropod from China, with avian affinities, which also has long pennaceous feathers on its feet. This suggests that such morphology might represent a primitive adaptation close to the theropod–bird transition. The long metatarsus feathers are likely primitive for Eumaniraptora and might have played an important role in the origin of avian flight.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Recent fossil discoveries have substantially reduced the morphological gap between non-avian and avian dinosaurs, yet avians including Archaeopteryx differ from non-avian theropods in their limb proportions. In particular, avians have proportionally longer and more robust forelimbs that are capable of supporting a large aerodynamic surface. Here we report on a new maniraptoran dinosaur, Anchiornis huxleyi gen. et sp. nov., based on a specimen collected from lacustrine deposits of uncertain age in western Liaoning, China. With an estimated mass of 110 grams, Anchiornis is the smallest known non-avian theropod dinosaur. It exhibits some wrist features indicative of high mobility, presaging the wing-folding mechanisms seen in more derived birds and suggesting rapid evolution of the carpus. Otherwise, Anchiornis is intermediate in general morphology between non-avian and avian dinosaurs, particularly with regard to relative forelimb length and thickness, and represents a transitional step toward the avian condition. In contrast with some recent comprehensive phylogenetic analyses, our phylogenetic analysis incorporates subtle morphological variations and recovers a conventional result supporting the monophyly of Avialae.}},

Here we report on a new dromaeosaurid dinosaur, Microraptor zhaoianus gen. et sp. nov., from the Early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of Liaoning, China2. This is the first mature non-avian dinosaur to be found that is smaller than Archaeopteryx 1, and it eliminates the size disparity between the earliest birds and their closest non-avian theropod relatives. The more bird-like teeth, the Rahonavis -like ischium and the small number of caudal vertebrae of Microraptor are unique among dromaeosaurids and improve our understanding of the morphological transition to birds. The nearly completely articulated foot shows features, such as distally positioned digit I, slender and recurved pedal claws, and elongated penultimate phalanges, that are comparable to those of arboreal birds3, 4, 5, 6. The discovery of these in non-avian theropods provides new insights for studying the palaeoecology of some bird-like theropod dinosaurs.}},

The inclusion of the three articulated skeletons from Wolcott's Quarry, Manchester, Connecticut in a single species is supported. Despite claims to the contrary the Manchester skeletons can be referred to the species Anchisaurus polyzelus, which is based on a fragmentary specimen from Massachusetts. Two autapomorphies: dorsoventrally flattened ischial blades set at a low angle to each other and slender sacral ribs of the first sacral vertebra, link the holotype of A. polyzelus to the Manchester specimens. A revised diagnosis of the species and new skull reconstruction are presented. Recent anatomical observations of A. polyzelus indicate that several character states used to assess its phylogenetic position require revision. However, these are not sufficient to overturn previous cladistic analyses. A revised cladistic analysis continues to find support for Anchisaurus as a relatively derived basal sauropodomorph that lies outside of the clade Melanorosaurus + Sauropoda but is more closely related to it than to 'core prosauropods' such as Plateosaurus and Massospondylus.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The species taxonomy of the sauropodomorph dinosaurs from the L\"{o}wenstein Formation of Germany is examined. Previous work has classified these into two taxa: Sellosaurus gracilis from a number of localities and the widespread Plateosaurus engelhardti from a single monospecific accumulation in the L\"{o}wenstein Formation, near the town of Trossingen. The current hypodigm of Sellosaurus gracilis is found to contain a substantial amount of variation. This includes differences in the dentition, structure of the skull, composition of the sacrum and the structure of the caudal vertebrae and pelvis. This variation was analysed using a specimen–based parsimony analysis of the sauropodomorphs from the L\"{o}wenstein Formation. It was found that two discrete taxa comprise the current hypodigm of Sellosaurus. The more common of these two is a plesiomorphic form for which the correct name is Efraasia minor comb. nov. The less common form (which includes the holotype of Sellosaurus gracilis) is found to share a number of synapomorphies with Plateosaurus engelhardti and is placed in this genus as Plateosaurus gracilis}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT A new basal sauropodornorph dinosaur, Arcusaurus pereirabdalorum, sp. nov., is named and described on the basis of a partial, disarticulated but associated skull and dispersed cranial and postcranial elements from at least two individuals. Arcusaurus is part of a distinctive local fauna from the upper Elliot Formation (Lower Jurassic) in the Senekal District, Free State, South Africa. It can be diagnosed by various details of the premaxilla, nasal, and dentary in the skull and the shape of the distal caudal vertebrae. The taxon displays an unusual mix of characteristics. It lacks several synapomorphies of Plateosauria (Phteosaurus + Massospondylus and all descendants of their most recent common ancestor) but does display other derived characteristics that are otherwise known only from less inclusive clades within Plateosauria. In a cladistic analysis a position outside Plateosauria as the sister group of the clade of Efraasia + more-derived sauropodomorphs is supported; however, this position was not found to be a significantly better explanation of the data as a relatively derived position within Plateosauria. If the basal position for Arcusaurus is accepted, then a divergence from other sauropodomorphs in the middle Norian and a ghost lineage up to 35 Ma is implied. No other non-plateosaurian sauropodomorphs are known from the Jurassic, making Arcusaurus a potentially relictual taxon in the Early Jurassic.}},

It is found to be the sister group of a clade of obligatory quadrupedal sauropodomorphs ( + Sauropoda) and thus lies at the heart of the basal sauropodomorph–sauropod transition. The narrow jaws of retain a pointed symphysis but appear to have lacked fleshy cheeks. Broad, U-shaped jaws were previously thought to have evolved prior to the loss of gape-restricting cheeks. However, the narrow jaws of retain a pointed symphysis but appear to have lacked fleshy cheeks, demonstrating unappreciated homoplasy in the evolution of the sauropod bulk-browsing apparatus. The limbs of indicate that it retained a habitual bipedal gait although incipient characters associated with the pronation of the manus and the adoption of a quadrupedal gait are evident through geometric morphometric analysis (using thin-plate splines) of the ulna and femur. Cursorial ability appears to have been reduced and the weight bearing axis of the pes shifted to a medial, entaxonic position, falsifying the hypothesis that entaxony evolved in sauropods only after an obligate quadrupedal gait had been adopted.}},

These adaptations allowed the clade to produce the largest–ever terrestrial animals. However, A. ingenipes lacked specializations of the hand found in more derived sauropods that indicate it retained the ability to grasp.

Bremer support values for each internal node were calculated as a measure of clade strength. Additionally, the shortest trees that conformed to some alternative hypotheses were searched for. The following new taxa are established on the basis of the results: Euskelia (the clade containing the Eryopoidea and Dissorophoidea), Limnarchia (the clade containing Trimerorhachidae, Dvinosauroidea, Archegosauroidea and Stereospondyli), Dvinosauria (the clade containing Trimerorhachidae and Dvinosauroidea), Stereo-spondylomorpha (the clade containing Archegosauroidea and Stereospondyli), Capitosauria (the clade containing Lydekkerina and 'capitosauroids'), and Trematosauria (the clade containing Trematosauroidea, Rhytidosteidae, Plagiosauroidea, Metoposauroidea and Brachyopoidea). The monophyly of the assemblage of Mesozoic families called the Stereospondyli by Romer is supported. The dominance of the Stereospondyli in the Mesozoic and its rarity in the Palaeozoic is discussed. It is suggested that the radiation of the diverse stereospondyl clades, the Capitosauria and Trematosauria, began in the Late Permian of Gondwana, in a 'safe haven' that was less severely affected by the Late Permian extinction event. It is further speculated that the 'safe haven' was located in Antarctica, or possibly Australia.}},

Though the majority of these birds appear referable to the ornithuromorph Gansus yumenensis, a number of enantiornithine fossils have also been recovered. Here we report on a specimen consisting of a complete, three-dimensionally preserved sternum, furcula, and sternal ribs that represents a second ornithuromorph taxon from the Xiagou Formation at Changma. The fossil exhibits morphologies that distinguish it from all previously-known Xiagou birds and demonstrate that it represents a derived non-ornithurine member of Ornithuromorpha. Though it is morphologically distinct from the equivalent elements of all other described ornithuromorphs, the material is too incomplete to justify the erection of a new taxon. Nonetheless, it increases the taxonomic diversity of the Xiagou avifauna, thereby expanding our knowledge of Early Cretaceous avian diversity and evolution.}},

This early hadrosauroid sheds new light on the origin of the herbivorous feeding specializations of the Late Cretaceous duck-billed dinosaurs, and corroborates the view that the Iguanodontidae and the Hadrosauroidea are monophyletic clades, with the former characterized by an enlarged maxilla as the main mechanism for mastication, and the latter diagnosed by a smaller yet more mobile maxilla with an elaborate dental battery, separated by a diastema from the enlarged premaxilla.

A new phylogenetic analysis of Crocodylomorpha is presented, which finds G. giganteus to be nested within what is currently considered Dakosaurus, whereas the other species currently assigned to Geosaurus form a clade with Enaliosuchus and the holotype of Cricosaurus. The phyletic relationship of G. giganteus with other metriorhynchids indicates that the current definition of the genus Geosaurus is polyphyletic, and that the inclusion of subsequent longirostrine species to this genus is in error.

  Abstract                 = {{Metriorhynchids were a peculiar group of fully marine Mesozoic crocodylomorphs, some of which reached large body size and were probably apex predators. The estimation of their total body length in the past has proven problematic. Rigorous size estimation was provided using five complete metriorhynchid specimens, by means of regression equations derived from basicranial and femoral length against total body length. The use of the Alligator femoral regression equation as a proxy to estimate metriorhynchid total body length led to a slight underestimation, whereas cranial regression equations of extant genera resulted in an overestimation of body length. Therefore, the scaling of crania and femora to total body length of metriorhynchids is noticeably different from that of extant crocodylians, indicating that extant crocodylians are not ideal proxies for size reconstruction of extinct taxa that deviate from their semi-aquatic morphotype. The lack of a correlation between maximum, minimum, or the range of generic body lengths with species richness demonstrates that species diversification is driven by factors other than just variation in body size. Maximum likelihood modelling also found no evidence for directionality in body size evolution. However, niche partitioning in Metriorhynchidae is mediated not only by craniodental differentiation, as shown by previous studies, but also by body size variation. {\copyright} 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 163, 1199–1216.}},

A new sauropod dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous of Brazil represents the earliest advanced titanosaurian known to date, demonstrating that the initial diversification of advanced titanosaurians was well under way at least 30 million years before their known radiation in the latest Cretaceous. The new taxon also preserves the most complete skull among titanosaurians, further revealing that their low and elongated diplodocid-like skull morphology appeared much earlier than previously thought.}},

Its phylogenetic affinities within Crocodylomorpha are evaluated through a parsimony analysis involving 46 taxa and 198 characters. Mariliasuchus is nested well inside the clade Notosuchia, as the sister group of Comahuesuchus, a derived notosuchian from the Late Cretaceous of Argentina. Both taxa share the following unambiguous synapomorphies: ventral half of the lacrimal tapering posteroventrally, not contacting or only slightly contacting the jugal; presence of a large foramen on the lateral surface of the anterior part of the jugal; presence of procumbent premaxillary and anterior dentary alveoli; and ectopterygoids that do not participate of the palatine bar. The presence of procumbent premaxillary teeth, specialized tooth crown morphology, and fore?aft jaw movements suggests that this group presented complex jaw movements related to specialized feeding habits.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Therizinosaurians are among the most poorly understood dinosaurs. Their unusual morphology and fragmentary fossil record has precluded a synthetic understanding of the group since their remains were first discovered over 60 years ago. Although the clade was recently substantiated as a monophyletic group of maniraptoran theropods, little foundational work has been conducted at the species level. A recent plethora of therizinosaurian discoveries ? including the most complete primitive and derived members recovered to date ? permits an alpha taxonomic and phylogenetic re-evaluation of the clade. The phylogenetic analysis presented is the most comprehensive yet conducted for Therizinosauria, and provides a foundation for scrutinizing previous definitions of Therizinosauria, Therizinosauroidea and Therizinosauridae. Here, support is provided for the maintenance of all three taxa; however, Therizinosauria is redefined and Falcarius is excluded from Therizinosauroidea. In addition, the previously described therizinosauroids, Beipiaosaurus, Enigmosaurus, Suzhousaurus, Segnosaurus and Therizinosaurus, are rediagnosed and photodocumented. In contrast to other analyses, the ingroup topology recovered in this study suggests intermediate (therizinosauroid) status for Neimongosaurus, Erliansaurus and Enigmosaurus (based on relatively primitive pelvic morphology), despite the derived forelimb anatomy evident in the former two taxa. Here, the large-bodied taxa Nothronychus and Nanshiungosaurus brevispinus are recovered as therizinosaurids. This discrepancy indicates a relatively complex pattern of mosaic evolution, which may ultimately be found to correlate with body-size trends in the clade. This work also reviews the chronostratigraphic and biogeographic distribution of therizinosaurian taxa and putatively referred elements and finds no compelling evidence of the clade outside of Asia and North America, nor for the referral of therizinosaurian materials from Kazakhstan to cf. Neimongosaurus. Time calibration of ingroup relationships indicates a pre-Turonian dispersal event is needed to account for the presence of therizinosaurids in the Late Cretaceous of North America and Asia; this conclusion supports previous hypotheses of a Laurasian faunal interchange event during the Albian.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT The recent discovery of a dense, paucispecific bonebed from the Early Cretaceous Cedar Mountain Formation, central Utah, has yielded new information on the morphology and evolution of therizinosaurs. Detailed description of the pectoral girdle and forelimb of Falcarius utahensis?the predominant taxon recovered from this site?provides the basis for a species-level, phylogenetic investigation of this enigmatic group. The analysis, consisting of 32 characters arrayed among 13 taxa, supports previous assertions that Falcarius represents the basal-most known member of the clade. The analysis further supports a monophyletic Therizinosauroidea on the basis of seven unambiguous synapomorphies of the pectoral girdle and forelimb. Contrary to previous hypotheses, analysis of the pectoral girdle and forelimb suggests that Therizinosauridae is more appropriately defined as a derived clade including Nothronychus, Erlicosaurus, Neimongosaurus, Therizinosaurus, and Segnosaurus. Equally strong support is recovered for a clade containing these five genera plus ?Alectrosaurus? and Erliansaurus. The morphology of primitive therizinosauroids?characterized by Falcarius, Beipiaosaurus, and Alxasaurus?suggests that Early Cretaceous taxa already exhibited the beginnings of a trend toward increased robustness and altered range of motion of the pectoral girdle and forelimb. Derived therizinosaurs exhibit an amplification of these evolutionary trends as well as increased dorsal reach, increased wrist flexibility, and severe reduction in manual digit length. The functional reorganization of the pectoral girdle and forelimb throughout the evolutionary history of therizinosaurs can be reasonably attributed to a shift from obligatory predation to a novel paleoecological role that reached its pinnacle in derived Late Cretaceous members.}},

A recent plethora of maniraptoran discoveries has produced evidence challenging this notion. Here, we report on a new species of maniraptoran theropod, sp. nov. Relative completeness of this specimen permits a phylogenetic reassessment of Therizinosauria—the theropod clade exhibiting the most substantial anatomical evidence of herbivory. In the most comprehensive phylogenetic study of the clade conducted to date, we recover Therizinosauria as the basalmost maniraptoran lineage. Using concentrated changes tests, we present evidence for correlated character evolution among herbivorous and hypercarnivorous taxa and propose ecomorphological indicators for future interpretations of diet among maniraptoran clades. Maximum parsimony optimizations of character evolution within our study indicate an ancestral origin for dietary plasticity and facultative herbivory (omnivory) within the clade. These findings suggest that hypercarnivory in paravian dinosaurs is a secondarily derived dietary specialization and provide a potential mechanism for the invasion of novel morpho- and ecospace early in coelurosaurian evolution—the loss of obligate carnivory and origin of dietary opportunism.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Troodontids are a predominantly small-bodied group of feathered theropod dinosaurs notable for their close evolutionary relationship with Avialae. Despite a diverse Asian representation with remarkable growth in recent years, the North American record of the clade remains poor, with only one controversial species—Troodon formosus—presently known from substantial skeletal remains. Here we report a gracile new troodontid theropod—Talos sampsoni gen. et sp. nov.—from the Upper Cretaceous Kaiparowits Formation, Utah, USA, representing one of the most complete troodontid skeletons described from North America to date. Histological assessment of the holotype specimen indicates that the adult body size of Talos was notably smaller than that of the contemporary genus Troodon. Phylogenetic analysis recovers Talos as a member of a derived, latest Cretaceous subclade, minimally containing Troodon, Saurornithoides, and Zanabazar. MicroCT scans reveal extreme pathological remodeling on pedal phalanx II-1 of the holotype specimen likely resulting from physical trauma and subsequent infectious processes. Talos sampsoni adds to the singularity of the Kaiparowits Formation dinosaur fauna, which is represented by at least 10 previously unrecognized species including the recently named ceratopsids Utahceratops and Kosmoceratops, the hadrosaurine Gryposaurus monumentensis, the tyrannosaurid Teratophoneus, and the oviraptorosaurian Hagryphus. The presence of a distinct troodontid taxon in the Kaiparowits Formation supports the hypothesis that late Campanian dinosaurs of the Western Interior Basin exhibited restricted geographic ranges and suggests that the taxonomic diversity of Late Cretaceous troodontids from North America is currently underestimated. An apparent traumatic injury to the foot of Talos with evidence of subsequent healing sheds new light on the paleobiology of deinonychosaurians by bolstering functional interpretations of prey grappling and/or intraspecific combat for the second pedal digit, and supporting trackway evidence indicating a minimal role in weight bearing.}},

  Abstract                 = {{A phylogenetic analysis of reproductive and oological (egg) traits of theropod taxa allows determination of the sequence in which these traits evolved in Theropoda. Our results indicate that several avian reproductive traits, such as adults sitting on eggs, asymmetrical eggs, unornamented eggshell surface, and complex eggshell ultrastructure, were already present in non-avian maniraptorans, and could have evolved in more basal theropods. In addition, non-avian maniraptorans laid two eggs at a time and orientated their eggs subvertically or subhorizontally in their nests, features not retained by neornithine birds. Based on our cladistic analysis it is also possible to infer the phylogenetic affinity of ootaxa of unknown parentage: Protoceratopsidovum was laid by a maniraptoran more derived than oviraptorids, and Parvoolithus probably belonged to a Cretaceous bird. Finally, our analysis reveals that many of the high-level categories of egg parataxonomy (morphotypes and basic types) are unnatural groupings (i.e. non-monophyletic). We recommend that these high-level categories be abandoned because oofamilies are sufficient to categorize egg taxa.}},

Here we describe Eoconfuciusornis zhengi, gen. et sp. nov. from the Early Cretaceous Dabeigou Formatio (131 Ma) in Fengning, Hebei Province, northern China. It represents a new and, more primitive than other known, member of this group and extends the lifespan of this family to 11 Ma, the longest of any known Early Cretaceous avian lineages. Furthermore, Eoconfuciusornis and its relatives present many osteological transformations, such as the size increase of the deltopectoral crest of the humerus and the keel of the sternum, apparently an adaptation toward improved flight in the evolution of the Confuciusornithidae.}},

This juvenile coelurosaur's third manual digit is extremely elongated, distinctively different from that of other known dinosaurs and birds. It represents certainly a type of adaptation previously unreported from the Mesozoic although the exact function of the third manual digit is unclear. The relatively long forelimb, penultimate phalanx of manual digit II, and pedal penultimate phalanges, are interpreted as evidence for the arboreal habit of Epidendrosaurus. Because Epidendrosaurus is more similar to advanced birds in some arboreal features than to Archaeopteryx, we suggest that the initial appearance of tree-adaptation in theropods was probably not directly related to flight but to other functions, such as seeking food or escaping from predators.

This new species is characterized by an unexpected combination of characters seen in several different theropod groups, particularly the Oviraptorosauria. Phylogenetic analysis shows it to be the sister taxon to Epidendrosaurus4, 5, forming a new clade at the base of Avialae6. Epidexipteryx also possesses two pairs of elongate ribbon-like tail feathers, and its limbs lack contour feathers for flight. This finding shows that a member of the avialan lineage experimented with integumentary ornamentation as early as the Middle to Late Jurassic, and provides further evidence relating to this aspect of the transition from non-avian theropods to birds.}},

Here we report a new heterodontosaurid, Tianyulong confuciusi gen. et sp. nov., from the Early Cretaceous period (144–99 million years ago) of western Liaoning Province, China. Tianyulong extends the geographical distribution of heterodontosaurids to Asia and confirms the clade's previously questionable temporal range extension into the Early Cretaceous period. More surprisingly, Tianyulong bears long, singular and unbranched filamentous integumentary (outer skin) structures. This represents the first confirmed report, to our knowledge, of filamentous integumentary structures in an ornithischian dinosaur.}},

Here we report the largest Early Cretaceous enantiornithine bird from north-east China, which provides evidence that basal members of Enantiornithes share more morphologies with ornithurine birds than previously recognized. Morphological evolution in these two groups has been thought to be largely parallel, with derived members of Enantiornithes convergent on the 'advanced' flight capabilities of ornithurine birds. The presence of an array of morphologies previously thought to be derived within ornithurine and enantiornithine birds in a basal enantiornithine species provides evidence of the complex character evolution in these two major lineages. The cranial morphology of the new specimen is among the best preserved for Mesozoic avians. The new species extends the size range known for Early Cretaceous Enantiornithes significantly and provides evidence of forelimb to hind limb proportions distinct from all other known members of the clade. As such, it sheds new light on avian body size evolution and diversity, and allows a re-evaluation of a previously proposed hypothesis of competitive exclusion among Early Cretaceous avian clades.}},

The new taxon is characterized by possessing the following combination of features: upper and lower jaws toothless, snout pointed, humerus with large and robust deltopectoral crest, second phalanx of the major manual digit longer than the first phalanx, unguals of the alular and major digits of similar length and significantly shorter than the corresponding penultimate phalanges, tibiotarsus slender and more than twice the length of the tarsometatarsus, and metatarsal IV longer than the other metatarsals. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Zhongjianornis is phylogenetically basal to Confuciusornis and the dominant Mesozoic avian groups, Enantiornithes and Ornithurae, and therefore provides significant new information regarding the diversification of birds in the Early Cretaceous. It also represents the most basal bird that completely lacks teeth, suggesting that tooth loss was more common than expected in early avian evolution and that the avian beak appeared independently in several avian lineages, most probably as a response to selective pressure for weight reduction. Finally, the presence of a significantly enlarged humeral deltopectoral crest suggests that Zhongjianornis shares with other basal birds such as Jeholornis, Sapeornis and Confuciusornis a distinctive mode of adaptation for flight contrasting with that seen in more advanced birds, which instead possess an elongated sternum and a prominent keel.}},

The bird had completely reduced teeth and possessed a beak in both the upper and lower jaws, representing the earliest known beaked ornithurine. The preservation of a predentary bone confirms that this structure is not unique to ornithischian dinosaurs but was common in early ornithurine birds. This small bird had a strong flying capability with a low aspect ratio wing. It was probably a wader, feeding in shallow water or marshes. This find confirms that the aquatic environment had played a key role in the origin and early radiation of ornithurines, one branch of which eventually gave rise to extant birds near the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary.

Here we report a large basal bird, Jeholornis prima gen. et sp. nov., from the Jiufotang Formation. This bird is distinctively different from other known birds of the Early Cretaceous period in retaining a long skeletal tail with unexpected elongated prezygopophyses and chevrons, resembling that of dromaeosaurids4, 5, 6, providing a further link between birds and non-avian theropods7, 8. Despite its basal position in early avian evolution, the advanced features of the pectoral girdle and the carpal trochlea of the carpometacarpus of Jeholornis indicate the capability of powerful flight. The dozens of beautifully preserved ovules of unknown plant taxa in the stomach represents direct evidence for seed-eating adaptation in birds of the Mesozoic era.}},

  Abstract                 = {{With only one known exception, early Cretaceous birds were smaller than their closest theropod dinosaur relatives. Here we report on a new bird from the Early Cretaceous feathered-dinosaur-bearing continental deposits of Liaoning, northeast China, which is not only larger than Archaeopteryx but is nearly twice as large as the basal dromaeosaur Microraptor. The new taxon, Sapeornis chaoyangensis gen. et sp. nov., has a more basal phylogenetic position than all other birds except for Archaeopteryx. Its exceptionally long forelimbs, well-developed deltoid crest of the humerus, proximally fused metacarpals, relatively short hindlimbs and short pygostyle indicate powerful soaring capability and further suggest that by the Early Cretaceous ecological diversification of early birds was greater than previously assumed.

It was the first component of the tetrapod body plan to evolve, well before the origin of limbs, and is therefore crucial to our understanding of the beginning of the fish–tetrapod transition. However, there is no consensus on the origin of the choana despite decades of heated debate1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; some have claimed that it represents a palatally displaced external nostril4, 6, but others have argued that this is implausible because it implies breaking and rejoining the maxillary–premaxillary dental arcade and the maxillary branch of nerve V2, 6. The fossil record has not resolved the dispute, because the choana is fully developed in known tetrapod stem-group members8, 10, 11. Here we present new material of Kenichthys, a 395-million-year-old fossil fish from China12, 13, 14, that provides direct evidence for the origin of the choana and establishes its homology: it is indeed a displaced posterior external nostril that, during a brief transitional stage illustrated by Kenichthys, separated the maxilla from the premaxilla.}},

However, no previously known fossil taxon exhibits a concrete character combination approximating the condition expected in the last common ancestor of tetrapods and lungfish—and it is still poorly understood how early sarcopterygians diverged into the tetrapod lineage (Tetrapodomorpha)7 and the lungfish lineage (Dipnomorpha)7. Here we describe a fossil sarcopterygian fish, Styloichthys changae gen. et sp. nov., that possesses an eyestalk and which exhibits the character combination expected in a stem group close to the last common ancestor of tetrapods and lungfish. Styloichthys from the Lower Devonian of China bridges the morphological gap between stem-group sarcopterygians (Psarolepis and Achoania)10 and basal tetrapodomorphs/basal dipnomorphs. It provides information that will help in the study of the relationship of early sarcopterygians, and which will also help to resolve the tetrapod–lungfish divergence into a documented sequence of character acquisition.}},

Here we describe a primitive fossil fish, Meemannia eos gen. et sp. nov., that possesses an actinopterygian-like skull roof and a cosmine-like dermal surface combining a pore–canal network (found in various fossil sarcopterygians) with superimposed layers of odontodes and enamel (previously known in actinopterygians and some acanthodians11, 12, 13). This 405-million-year-old fish from the Lower Devonian of Yunnan (China) demonstrates that cosmine in many fossil sarcopterygians arose step by step through the acquisition of a pore–canal network followed by the subsequently developed ability to resorb previous generations of odontodes and enamel.
